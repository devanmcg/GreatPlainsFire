  abstract     = {Large wildfires (.40 ha) account for the majority of burned area across the contiguous United States (US) and appropriate substantial suppression resources. A variety of environmental and social factors influence wildfire growth and whether a fire overcomes initial attack efforts and becomes a large wildfire. However, little is known about how these factors differ between lightning-caused and human-caused wildfires. This study examines differences in temperature, vapour pressure deficit, fuel moisture and wind speed for large and small lightning- and human-caused wildfires during the initial days of fire activity at ecoregion scales across the US. Large fires of both human and lightning origin occurred coincident with above-normal temperature and vapour pressure deficit and below-normal 100-hour dead fuel moisture compared with small fires. Large human-caused wildfires occurred, on average, coincident with higher wind speeds than small human-caused wildfires and large lightning-caused wildfires. These results suggest the importance of winds in driving rapid fire growth that can allow fires to overcome many of the factors that typically inhibit large human-caused fires. Additionally, such findings highlight the interplay between human activity and meteorological conditions and the importance of incorporating winds in modelling large-fire risk in human-dominated landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is the material left behind after incomplete combustion of biomass, including a spectrum of materials ranging from charcoal to lightly charred biomass. We investigated the roles of combustion temperature and properties of soil at two distinct landform positions on carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from soil and decomposition of PyC. Bark from Pinus jeffreyi was charred at three temperatures (200 °C, 350 °C, and 500 °C) for an hour to create PyC before it was incubated with soil collected from eroding and depositional landform positions along the same hillslope. We determined the fraction of PyC in soil C at the beginning and end of the incubation using the Kurth-MacKenzie-Deluca digestion method. We found rates of microbial respiration in soil from the depositional landform position were over three times higher than from soil from the eroding landform position. The soil from the eroding landform position had less optimal decomposition conditions, including water holding capacity and organic matter content, compared with the soil from the depositional landform position. Furthermore, over the length of the incubation experiment, PyC concentrations decreased only in depositional soils that contained lower temperature chars, indicating that low temperature PyC has shorter residence times in soils from depositional landform positions, compared to eroding ones. Using scanning electron microscopy, we also observed physical decay of the low temperature chars. Previous research has shown that PyC is preferentially eroded from hillslopes post-fire. Here we show that erosion of PyC and deposition into depositional landform positions can cause the decay rate of PyC to significantly increase, exerting a significant control on the long-term fate of PyC in the soil system.},

Visibilities at accident sites have been estimated in the range from 1 to 3 m (extinction coefficients between 1000 and 4000). Temperature and relative humidity measurements were taken from 29 “smokes” during 2002 and 2003. These data were converted to a measure of the mass of water vapor present to the mass of dry air containing the vapor (smoke mixing ratio). Smoke temperatures were processed through a simple radiation model before smokes were mixed with ambient air with temperature and moisture observed during the early morning on the days following the burns. Calculations show supersaturations implying liquid water contents (LWC) up to 17 times as large as LWC found in natural fog. Simple models combining fog droplet number density, droplet size, and LWC show that the supersaturation LWC of smokes is capable of reducing visibility to the ranges observed.},

  abstract     = {Fire is a major disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems, leading to landscape transformation in fire-prone areas. Species in mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are unclear. We use bipartite insect–flower interaction networks across a recently burned landscape to explore how plant–pollinator interaction networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level, and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower-visiting insects during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of flower-visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However, species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower-rich fire refuges sustain plant–pollinator interactions, especially those involving specialized species, in fire-disturbed landscape. This may be an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.},

  abstract     = {Soils constitute one of the most valuable resources on earth, especially because soil is renewable on human time scales. During the 20th century, a period marked by a widespread rural exodus and land abandonment, fire suppression policies were adopted facilitating the accumulation of fuel in forested areas, exacerbating the effects of wildfires, leading to severe degradation of soils. Prescribed fires emerged as an option for protecting forests and their soils from wildfires through the reduction of fuels levels. However such fires can serve other objectives, including stimulating the regeneration of a particular plant species, maintaining biological diversity or as a tool for recovering grasslands in encroached lands. This paper reviews studies examining the short- and long- term impacts of prescribed fires on the physical, chemical and biological soil properties; in so doing, it provides a summary of the benefits and drawbacks of this technique, to help determine if prescribed fires can be useful for managing the landscape. From the study conducted, we can affirm that prescribed fires affects soil properties but differ greatly depending on soil initial characteristics, vegetation or type of fire. Also, it is possible to see that soil's physical and biological properties are more strongly affected by prescribed fires than are its chemical properties. Finally, we conclude that prescribed fires clearly constitute a disturbance on the environment (positive, neutral or negative depending on the soil property studied), but most of the studies reviewed report a good recovery and their effects could be less pronounced than those of wildfires because of the limited soil heating and lower fire intensity and severity.},

The goal of this study was to identify suitable strategic locations on forest lands for fuel treatments in order to: 1) disrupt major fire movements, 2) reduce ember emissions, and 3) reduce the likelihood of large fires burning into residential communities. We first modeled fire spread, hazard and exposure metrics under historical extreme fire weather conditions, including node influence grid for surface fire pathways, crown fraction burned and fire transmission to residential structures. Then, we performed an optimization analysis on individual planning areas to identify production possibility frontiers for addressing fire exposure and explore alternative prescribed fire treatment configurations. The results revealed strong trade-offs among different fire exposure metrics, showed treatment mosaics that optimize the allocation of prescribed fire, and identified specific opportunities to achieve multiple objectives. Our methods can contribute to improving the efficiency of prescribed fire treatment investments and wildfire management programs aimed at creating fire resilient ecosystems, facilitating safe and efficient fire suppression, and safeguarding rural communities from catastrophic wildfires. The analysis framework can be used to optimally allocate prescribed fire in other fire-prone areas within the Mediterranean region and elsewhere.},

  abstract     = {Sustaining livestock agriculture is important for global food security. Livestock productivity, however, can fluctuate due to many environmental factors, including climate variability. Current predictions of continued warming, decreased precipitation, and increased climate variability worldwide raise serious questions for scientists and producers alike. Foremost is understanding how to mitigate livestock production losses attributed to climate extremes and variability. We investigated the influence of spatial heterogeneity on livestock production over six years in tallgrass prairie of the southern Great Plains, USA. We manipulated heterogeneity by allowing fire and grazing to interact spatially and temporally at broad scales across pastures ranging from 430 to 900ha. We found that the influence of precipitation on livestock productivity was contingent upon heterogeneity. When heterogeneity was absent, livestock productivity decreased with reduced rainfall. In contrast, when heterogeneity was present, there was no relationship with rainfall and livestock productivity, resulting in heterogeneity stabilizing livestock productivity through time. With predicted increases in climate variability and uncertainty, managing for heterogeneity may assist livestock producers in adapting to climate change and in mitigating livestock productivity loss caused by climatic variability.},

  abstract     = {The effect of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds has the potential to be a key component for climate change predictions, yet is one of the least understood. It is possible that high aerosol loading can change the convection intensity and hence the electrical activity of thunderstorm clouds. Focusing on the Amazon dry season, where thousands of man-made forest fires inject smoke into the atmosphere, we studied the aerosol effects on thunderclouds. We used the ground-based World-Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) lightning measurements together with Aqua-MODIS aerosol and cloud data to show evidence for the transition between two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds. The first is the microphysical effect which is manifested in an increase in convective intensity (and electrical activity), followed by the radiative effect that becomes dominant with the increase in aerosol loading leading to a decrease in convective intensity.},

Forest die-off constitutes a large uncertainty in projections of climate impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, climate–ecosystem interactions, and carbon-cycle feedbacks. Current understanding of the physiological mechanisms mediating climate-induced forest mortality limits the ability to model or project these threshold events. We report here a direct and in situ study of the mechanisms underlying recent widespread and climate-induced trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest mortality in western North America. We find substantial evidence of hydraulic failure of roots and branches linked to landscape patterns of canopy and root mortality in this species. On the contrary, we find no evidence that drought stress led to depletion of carbohydrate reserves. Our results illuminate proximate mechanisms underpinning recent aspen forest mortality and provide guidance for understanding and projecting forest die-offs under climate change.},

  abstract     = {Every year large proportions of northern Australia's tropical savanna landscapes are burnt, resulting in high fire frequencies and short intervals between fires. The dominant fire management paradigm in these regions is the use of low-intensity prescribed fire early in the dry season, to reduce the incidence of higher-intensity, more extensive wildfire later in the year. This use of frequent prescribed fire to mitigate against high-intensity wildfire has parallels with fire management in temperate forests of southern Australia. However, unlike in southern Australia, the ecological implications of high fire frequency have received little attention in the north. CSIRO and collaborators recently completed a landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, and here we provide a synthesis of the effects of experimental fire regimes on biodiversity, with particular consideration of fire frequency and, more specifically, time-since-fire. Two recurring themes emerged from Kapalga. First, much of the savanna biota is remarkably resilient to fire, even of high intensity. Over the 5-year experimental period, the abundance of most invertebrate groups remained unaffected by fire treatment, as did the abundance of most vertebrate species, and we were unable to detect any effect of fire on floristic composition of the grass-layer. Riparian vegetation and associated stream biota, as well as small mammals, were notable exceptions to this general resilience. Second, the occurrence of fire, independent of its intensity, was often the major factor influencing fire-sensitive species. This was especially the case for extinction-prone small mammals, which have suffered serious population declines across northern Australia in recent decades. Results from Kapalga indicate that key components of the savanna biota of northern Australia favour habitat that has remained unburnt for at least several years. This raises a serious conservation concern, given that very little relatively long unburnt habitat currently occurs in conservation reserves, with most sites being burnt at least once every 2 years. We propose a conservation objective of increasing the area that remains relatively long unburnt. This could be achieved either by reducing the proportion of the landscape burnt each year, or by setting prescribed fires more strategically. The provision of appropriately long unburnt habitat is a conservation challenge for Australia's tropical savanna landscapes, just as it is for its temperate forests.},

The abundance of all insects combined was significantly lower on the burned site than on the unburned site in the 1st yr postburn but not in subsequent years of the study. Of the selected insect groups, ants were significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) more abundant on the burned site than the unburned site for the 1st yr after the fire but not during the 2nd or 3rd. However, for Homoptera the pattern of abundance on burned and unburned sites was reversed. No significant differences in numbers of grasshoppers occurred between burned and unburned sites for any year. However, grasshopper biomass was significantly greater on the unburned site than on the burned site 1 yr postburn but not 2 or 3. Of the two most abundant grasshoppers, Conocephalus strictus was more abundant on the burned site than the unburned site for the 1st and 2nd yr after the burn but not the 3rd, whereas, for Melanoplus flavidus, the pattern of abundance was reversed on burned and unburned sites. The results indicate that while there were varied responses of these insects to fire, none experienced a severe decline in abundance following fire, suggesting they are adapted to habitats experiencing periodic burning.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed fire is used to reduce size and density of prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp.) in many rangeland ecosystems. However, effects of dormant season fires (i.e., winter fires) are inconsistent. Thus, there is increasing interest in use of growing season (summer) fires. Our objective was to evaluate effects of fire season and fire intensity on mortality and individual plant (i.e., ‘‘motte’’) structure (area per motte, cladodes per motte, motte height) of brownspine prickly pear (O. phaeacantha Engelm.). The study had 4 treatments: no fire, low-intensity winter fire, high-intensity winter fire, and summer fire. Three sizes of prickly pear mottes were evaluated: small (0–20 cladodes per motte), medium (21–100), and large (101–500). At 3 years postfire, prickly pear mortality in the summer fire treatment was 100\% in small mottes, 90\% in medium mottes, and 80\% in large mottes. Motte mortality increased in this treatment over time, especially in large mottes. Mortality from high-intensity winter fires was 29\% and 19\% in small and medium mottes, respectively, but no large mottes were killed. Motte mortality was , 10\% in low-intensity winter fire and no-fire treatments. Summer fires reduced all motte structural variables to 0 in small mottes and nearly 0 in other motte size classes. High-intensity winter fires reduced some structural variables of medium and large mottes, but had no long-term negative effects on area per motte or cladodes per motte in surviving small mottes. Low-intensity winter fires had no long-term negative effects on motte structure in any size class. Rapid growth of mottes, and especially small mottes, in the no-fire treatment suggested that resistance to winter fires can occur rapidly.},

  abstract     = {Roughly 3\% of the Earth’s land surface burns annually, representing a critical exchange of energy and matter between the land and atmosphere via combustion. Fires range from slow smouldering peat fires, to low-intensity surface fires, to intense crown fires, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and fire are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels—namely plants and their litter—that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote fire numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the flammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to influence fire regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the fire feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as patterns of fire over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.},

The fertility of different substrates in ranked in relation to the mean annual rainfall required for rainforest: basalt{$>$} alluvium{$>$}sedimentary metamorphics{$>$}granite. The relationship between fire behaviour and hillslope is suggested as an explanation of the slope of rainforest boundaries (boundary slope \$\textbackslash thicksimeq hillslope - 5\textbackslash circ\$). Although rainforest is usually down-slope of pyrophytic vegetation, in some situations rainforest may occur at higher altitudes but it is rarely directly upslope: rainforest occurs in valleys with pyrophytic vegetation on adjacent ridges. Only where the upper substrate is considerably more fertile does rainforest occur directly upslope, and then only on slopes of less than about 206⚬. Changes in boundary location are related to changes in the fire regime, and the long-term migration of rainforest is discussed. Site characteristics are insufficient to predict the location of rainforest boundaries without a knowledge of the vegetation and fire history.},

  abstract     = {Fire passage is accompanied by a heat wave and ash deposition affecting the upper soil layer. Changes in soil properties are directly related to heat intensity, the amounts of ashes deposited, and soil type. We subjected two soils (gypsiferous soil and calcareous soil) to artificial heating and ash incorporation and compared changes in select chemical and physical properties. The two soils studied were selected to provide a wide range of characteristics in soils of the semiarid Ebro Valley (NE Spain). Samples of both soils were heated for 30 minutes in a muffle furnace at temperatures of 25 , 150 , 250  and 500 C. Ashes were added only on soil samples heated at 250 C, in a quantity related to plant biomass growing on each soil (twice the amount in calcareous soil than in gypsiferous soil). Increasing heat intensity increased organic matter combustion as well as nutrient availability. Heating soil to 250 C caused a decrease in pH and an increase in electrolytic conductivity (ECe) and soluble Ca. Heating soil to 500 C caused an increase in pH and a decrease in ECe and soluble Ca. Total N content decreased at temperatures greater than 250 C, with about one-third being volatilized. Changes in chemical properties were similar for both soils although quantitative differences between soils were found. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) was reduced for gypsiferous soil heated to 500 C and to 250 C for calcareous soil. Heating increased sand-sized particles by fusion of clay, greatest in soil heated to 500 C. Soil aggregate stability (SAS) of both soils was reduced by heating to 250 C with greater reductions at 500 C, likely due to a reduction in organic matter and clay size particle content. A negative correlation was observed among SAS and soil erodibility (K-USLE). Bulk density and particle density increased in both soils when heated to 500 C. Water availability increased when soils were heated to 500 C, likely due to texture and structural modifications. Addition of the ashes increased organic matter content, C=N ratio, and pH in both soils and increased nutrient availability. These responses were greater in calcareous than in gypsiferous soil. Physical soil properties were not significantly modified by ash addition.},

The aim of this work is to identify the spatiotemporal distribution of wildfires hotspots in Sardinia (Italy) during 2000–2013 and to relate their dynamics with remotely-sensed NDVI-based fuel phenology patterns. We considered eleven bi-weekly time frames (TFs) and used kernel density (KD) estimation to spatialize the corresponding fire ignitions. Then, to identify zones of fire occurrence concentration, we performed a quartile classification of the KD values for each TF considered. Finally, we analyzed the spatio-temporal association between the ignitions hotspots and the remotely-sensed fuel phenology patterns by means of a correspondence analysis and a selectivity ratio. We found that wildfires hotspots are strictly related to anthropogenic pressure and to the spatio-temporal variation of fuel conditions in terms of both load and moisture: areas with less fires concentration proved to be mainly associated to coarse fuels with low seasonal NDVI variability; to the contrary, the fire hotspots resulted strictly correlated to fine fuels with high seasonal NDVI variability. Understanding the association between the seasonal distribution of wildfires hotspots and fuel phenology may allow the projection of fire ignition patterns to future, especially under changing climatic scenarios.},

The formation of depositional crusts by ash have been observed at the pore and plot scales, but the causes and temporal evolution of ash layers and associated crusts have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In the long term, ash crusting effects will decrease as the ash layer is removed by wind and water erosion, but in the short term ash crusting could contribute to the observed changes in post-fire runoff. This research addresses these topics by studying the evolution over time of highly combusted ash layers from two high-severity wildfires that occurred in Montana in 2011. More specifically, this research was designed to assess the potential for ash crusts to form and thereby contribute to the observed decreases in infiltration after forest fires. Results indicate that high-combustion ash can evolve due to postfire rainfall. Plots that exhibited a visible ash crust also displayed a significant decrease in effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity. These decreases in ash layer characteristics were attributed to raindrop compaction and ash hydration resulting in the formation of carbonate crystals, which decreased effective porosity and flow within the ash layer. During this same time period, inorganic carbon content more than doubled from 11 to 26\% and bulk density significantly increased from 0.22 to 0.39 g cmÀ3 on crusted plots. Although raindrop impact increased the robustness of the ash crust, mineralogical transformations must occur to produce a hydrologically relevant ash crust. These results indicate that postfire rainfall is an important control on the properties of the ash layer after burning and on crust formation. The observed temporal changes indicate that the timing of ash sampling can alter the predictions as to whether the ash layer is effecting post-fire infiltration and runoff. Despite the reduction in infiltration capacity, the formation of post-fire ash crusts could prove beneficial to post-fire hazard mitigation by stabilising the ash layer, and reducing aeolian mixing and erosion.},

  abstract     = {Forest fires are very common in tropical region during FebruaryeMay months and are known to have significant impact on ecosystem dynamics. Moreover, aerosols emitted from these burning activities significantly modulate the Earth's radiation budget. In present study, we investigated the anomalous forest fire events and their impact on atmospheric radiation budget and glaciated snow cover over the Himalayan region. We used multiple dataset derived from satellites [Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)] and reanalysis models [Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), Second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application (MERRA-2) and ERA-interim] to evaluate the effect of biomass burning aerosols on radiation budget. April 2016 is associated with anomalous fire activities over lower Himalayan region in the last fourteen years (2003e2016). The model estimated organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) emission reaches up to \textasciitilde 3 Â 104 and \textasciitilde 2 Â 103 mg/m2/day, respectively during the biomass burning period of April 2016. The meteorological data analysis accompanied with CALIOP aerosol vertical profile shows that these carbonaceous aerosols could reach up to \textasciitilde 5e7 km altitude and could be transported towards glaciated region of upper Himalayas. The large amount of BC/OC from biomass burning significantly modulates the atmospheric radiation budget. The estimated columnar heating rate shows that these carbonaceous aerosols could heat up the atmosphere by \textasciitilde 0.04e0.06 K/day in April-2016 with respect to non-burning period (2015). The glaciated snow cover fractions are found to be decreasing by \textasciitilde 5e20\% in 2016 as compared to long term mean (2003e2016). The combined analyses of various climatic factors, fires and associated BC emissions show that the observed snow cover decrease could be results of increased surface/atmospheric temperature due to combined effect of large scale climatic changes and BC absorption. Our results suggest that biomass burning can have significant effects on the Himalayan region, particularly in view of its importance in hydrological cycle and ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {The African continent is portrayed in development texts as experiencing environmental crises of staggering proportions. Despite a lack of reliable data, the World Bank considers environmental degradation to be so widespread that the ‘business’ of environmental planning and regulation is now seen as a global affair. It currently requires low-income countries receiving its financial assistance to develop National Environmental Action Plans (NEAPs) which, in assembly-line fashion, are being produced according to a blueprint. Taking the West African case study of Côte d'Ivoire, this paper argues that the planning process, specifically the identification of environmental problems, is based on a poor understanding of the nature and direction of environmental change. We confront this data problem by contrasting the image of a deforested savanna landscape found in the Côte d'Ivoire NEAP with the more wooded landscape experienced by farmers and herders and confirmed by our analysis of aerial photographs. Our second objective is to address the policy implications of two geographical issues rising from this paper: the disjointed scale problem between local/regional environmental-change patterns and global environmental discourses, and the human-environmental consequences of ignoring actual versus imagined environmental problems. A third goal is to contribute to the growing convergence in cultural and political ecology around the use of multiple research methods to explain environmental-change dynamics. Our discussion of environmental change is informed by intensive data collection in two rural communities in the Korhogo region of northern Côte d'Ivoire. Research methods included focus-group discussions and household surveys to record local perceptions of environmental change. Aerial photo analysis, GIS mapping, and vegetation transects were used to interpret land-cover changes. Finally, interviews with individuals involved in the NEAP process in the Côte d'Ivoire government, World Bank, and NGOs illuminated the received ideas and institutional interests of various players in environmental planning.},

  abstract     = {Climate warming and drying are modifying the fire dynamics of many boreal forests, moving them towards a regime with a higher frequency of extreme fire years characterized by large burns of high severity. Plot-scale studies indicate that increased burn severity favors the recruitment of deciduous trees in the initial years following fire. Consequently, a set of biophysical effects of burn severity on postfire boreal successional trajectories at decadal timescales have been hypothesized. Prominent among these are a greater cover of deciduous tree species in intermediately aged stands after more severe burning, with associated implications for carbon and energy balances. Here we investigate whether the current vegetation composition of interior Alaska supports this hypothesis. A chronosequence of six decades of vegetation regrowth following fire was created using a database of burn scars, an existing forest biomass map, and maps of albedo and the deciduous fraction of vegetation that we derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. The deciduous fraction map depicted the proportion of aboveground biomass in deciduous vegetation, derived using a RandomForest algorithm trained with field data sets (n 5 69, 71\% variance explained). Analysis of the difference Normalized Burn Ratio, a remotely sensed index commonly used as an indicator of burn severity, indicated that burn size and ignition date can provide a proxy of burn severity for historical fires. LIDAR remote sensing and a bioclimatic model of evergreen forest distribution were used to further refine the stratification of the current landscape by burn severity. Our results show that since the 1950s, more severely burned areas in interior Alaska have produced a vegetation cohort that is characterized by greater deciduous biomass. We discuss the importance of this shift in vegetation composition due to climate-induced changes in fire severity for carbon sequestration in forest biomass and surface reflectance (albedo), among other feedbacks to climate.},

The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences worldwide precipitation patterns and has occurred with regular periodicity over the last 130 000 years. We hypothesized that ENSO, through effects on local weather conditions, has influenced frequency and extent of fires within Everglades National Park (Florida, USA). Using data from 1948 to 1999, we found that the La Niña phase of ENSO was associated with decreased dry-season rainfall, lowered surface water levels, increased lightning strikes, more fires, and larger areas burned. In contrast, the El Niño phase was associated with increased dry-season rainfall, raised surface water levels, decreased lightning strikes, fewer fires, and smaller areas burned. Shifts between ENSO phases every few years have likely influenced vegetation through periodic large-scale fires, resulting in a prevalence of fire-influenced communities in the Everglades landscape.},

The study utilized (Psez\textasciitilde dotsugamenziesii - Tsziga heterophylla - Thuja plicata) slash in southwestem British Columbia, Canada, in an area where overland flow was negligible. Twenty-two plots containing a range of slash fuel loads were burned, nutrient (N, P, S, K, Mg, and Ca) losses to the atmosphere were measured, and nutrient (N, P, K, Mg, and Ca) losses in soil leachate were quantified for the first year postburn. For a given nutrient, total (atmospheric plus leachate) fire-induced losses were similar to atmospheric losses and could be reliably predicted from them due to the relatively low magnitude of leaching losses. Leaching losses were generally poorly related to atmospheric losses. Total, atmospheric, and most leaching losses increased as fire severity (defined as fuel consumption) increased. Nutrient losses were better estimated from fuel consumption variables than they were predicted from fuel load variables. As most of the results of the study were consistent with those of studies conducted elsewhere, these results likely apply to a wider geographic area and range of fire situations than those of the present study. The effort and cost of assessing total fireinduced losses in, at least, North American conifer forests can be minimized, without sacrificing much accuracy, by not measuring fire-induced soil leaching losses, but assuming these are 5-20 kglha, depending on the nutrient and the severity of the fire. If nutrient leaching into water bodies is to be quantified, then measurement of leaching losses would be necessary.},

Examination of the specific dates of both lightning and Santa Ana winds over 25 years shows that Santa Ana winds are very rare during or even within ten days of lightning strikes. The median lag between the two phenomena is 52 days, and on those occasions when lightning does occur shortly before Santa Ana winds, the actual density of strikes is very low. The rarity of lightning as ignition for Santa Ana-driven fires suggests that the current fire regime dominated by such fires is largely a product of the abundance of human-caused ignition.},

  abstract     = {Global warming is projected to be greatest in northern regions, where forest fires are also increasing in frequency. Thus, interactions between fire and temperature on soil respiration at high latitudes should be considered in determining feedbacks to climate. We tested the hypothesis that experimental warming will augment soil CO2 flux in a recently burned boreal forest by promoting microbial and root growth, but that this increase will be less apparent in more severely burned areas. We used open-top chambers to raise temperatures 0.4–0.9 1C across two levels of burn severity in a fire scar in Alaskan black spruce forest. After 3 consecutive years of warming, soil respiration was measured through a portable gas exchange system. Abundance of active microbes was determined by using Biolog EcoPlatesTM for bacteria and ergosterol analysis for fungi. Elevated temperatures increased soil CO2 flux by 20\% and reduced root biomass, but had no effect on bacterial or fungal abundance or soil organic matter (SOM) content. Soil respiration, fungal abundance, SOM, and root biomass decreased with increasing burn severity. There were no significant interactions between temperature and burn severity with respect to any measurement. Higher soil respiration rates in the warmed plots may be because of higher metabolic activity of microbes or roots. All together, we found that postfire soils are a greater source of CO2 to the atmosphere under elevated temperatures even in severely burned areas, suggesting that global warming may produce a positive feedback to atmospheric CO2, even in young boreal ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {It is becoming increasingly apparent that the future of the Amazon rainforest is under threat from both climate change and agricultural practices such as deforestation and biomass burning. Atmospheric aerosols are likely to play an important role in the interaction between deforestation, fire and drought, but until now, observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in this region have been limited to time series of less than 7 years for satellite retrievals, or to single-site measurements. Here we use a 13-year time series of Along Track Scanning Radiometer derived AOD measurements to examine the role of aerosols in biosphere-climate interactions over the Amazon. The seasonal cycle of AOD shows peaks in March and September. The September peak is caused by local dry-season biomass burning. The March peak has not been identified previously but is coincident with more remote fires located in northern South America. A decreasing trend in dry-season AOD between 1995 and 2000 and a subsequent increase from 2000 to 2004 can be explained by deforestation practices driven by economic forces, whereas even higher AOD levels in 2005 were probably caused more by the exceptional drought of that year. Throughout the time series, dry-season AODs are inversely correlated with dry-season precipitation, suggesting a positive feedback between aerosols and drought that may contribute to enhanced drought under climate change.},

  abstract     = {Both invasive mesopredators and altered fire regimes impact populations of vulnerable native species. Understanding how these forces interact is critical for designing better conservation measures for endangered species. This study draws on Indigenous ecological knowledge and practice to explore heterogeneity in faunal responses to Indigenously managed landscapes in the Western Desert of Australia. Using track plot surveys and satellite image analysis of fire histories, we find evidence that pyrodiversity increases activity measures of dingoes and monitor lizards. Dingoes were more active in recently burnt patches, while foxes were more active in slightly older burnt patches. These results add to previous work showing significant effects of pyrodiversity on kangaroo populations in the region. Together, the findings suggest that Aboriginal burning not only creates diverse niches for native animals, it helps to facilitate the ecological role of species that are themselves functionally vital. This work adds to a growing body of research suggesting that the loss of Aboriginal burning can cascade through ecosystems by transforming and simplifying ecological networks, thus contributing to the decline and extinction of vulnerable species.},

Some species known to prefer habitats with much bare ground and/or herbaceous foods temporarily increased following the fire.

The quantity and characteristics of ash produced during a wildland fire depend mainly on (1) the total burned fuel (i.e. fuel load), (2) fuel type and (3) its combustion completeness. For a given fuel load and type, a higher combustion completeness will reduce the ash organic carbon content, increasing the relative mineral content, and hence reducing total mass of ash produced. The homogeneity and thickness of the ash layer can vary substantially in space and time and reported average thicknesses range from close to 0 to 50 mm. Ash is a highly mobile material that, after its deposition, may be incorporated into the soil profile, redistributed or removed from a burned site within days or weeks by wind and water erosion to surface depressions, footslopes, streams, lakes, reservoirs and, potentially, into marine deposits.},

  abstract     = {We document Indigenous Ecological Knowledge and non-Indigenous observations of intentional fire-spreading by the fire-foraging raptors Black Kite (Milvus migrans), Whistling Kite (Haliastur sphenurus), and Brown Falcon (Falco berigora) in tropical Australian savannas. Observers report both solo and cooperative attempts, often successful, to spread wildfires intentionally via single-occasion or repeated transport of burning sticks in talons or beaks. This behavior, often represented in sacred ceremonies, is widely known to local people in the Northern Territory, where we carried out ethno-ornithological research from 2011 to 2017; it was also reported to us from Western Australia and Queensland. Though Aboriginal rangers and others who deal with bushfires take into account the risks posed by raptors that cause controlled burns to jump across firebreaks, official skepticism about the reality of avian fire-spreading hampers effective planning for landscape management and restoration. Via ethno-ornithological workshops and controlled field experiments with land managers, our collaborative research aims to situate fire-spreading as an important factor in fire management and fire ecology. In a broader sense, better understanding of avian fire-spreading, both in Australia and, potentially, elsewhere, can contribute to theories about the evolution of tropical savannas and the origins of human fire use.},

A high severity fire in January killed almost 86\% and 66\% of these two species, respectively, whereas a moderate severity fire after rain in April killed only 2·5\% of the individuals. Fire reduced basal diameters and percent foliar cover in these two species. Mortality rates forS. tenuis(20–38\%),S. longiglumis(15–20\%),Piptochaetium napostaense(12–28\%) andPoa ligularis(17–22\%) species that are heavily grazed by cattle, indicated that they were less sensitive to fire than were the other grasses. Fire, and probably the combined effect of fire and rest from grazing, increased basal diameters and percent foliar cover in the latter species.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports the first results of experiments and modelling of the radiant flash pyrolysis of cellulose. Small samples are exposed to brief flashes of a concentrated radiation, at the focus of an image furnace operating with a 5 kW xenon lamp associated to two elliptical mirrors. The mean heat flux densities may be higher than 107 W m−2. The microscopic observations of the sample after the flash reveal the presence of short life time liquid species formed for flash durations lower than about 1 s. These products which are liquid in pyrolysis conditions are solid at room temperature, where they show a good stability. They are soluble in water. For longer flashes, they give rise to vapours escaping in the gas phase, while practically no char is formed. These results show that, if in biomass pyrolysis, lignin is known to give rise to a liquid phase, it is also the case for cellulose. A first simple modelling of these experiments is proposed. It relies on heat and mass balances at the sample level, on the Broido–Shafizadeh (BS) model and on experimentally estimated values of some of the optical characteristics of cellulose (reflectivity and absorptivity). Indeed, cellulose is a highly reflecting and weakly absorbing (semi-transparent) material. These properties must be necessarily taken into account in any predictive calculation (only a small fraction of the incoming flux is effectively absorbed by cellulose). The calculated values of the times of beginning and end of the reaction are compared with the results of the experiments. The good agreement confirms that the intermediate products have life times shorter than about 1 s at the reaction temperature, predicted to be close to 750 K.},

The age and size class distributions of E. delegatensis on twenty-three sites of varying precipitation over its range on dolerite in Tasmania are strongly related to the floristic composition of the understorey vegetation and to moisture availability. No stands are even-aged, but all stands exhibit evidence of periodic rather than continuous recruitment, the periodicity of past recruitment events increasing with more mesic conditions. There is evidence for a change towards less frequent recruitment events in the higher rainfall stands since white settlement. An explanation for the variations in regeneration patterns is sought in the complex interactions between climate, fire frequency, fire intensity and understorey vegetation type.},

  abstract     = {Forest clumps occur scattered throughout Sorghum plumosum grasslands on chenier plains at Gurig National Park, Cobourg Peninsula, a preferred habitat for the introduced banteng (Bos javanicus.). The clumps are dominated by Pandanus spiralis, Acacia auriculiformis, Alstonia actinophylla, Timonius timon and Casuarina equisetifolia and vary in size from the radius of one tree crown to large patches of over several hectares. Fifteen of the 32 woody species recorded in 42 clumps occurred as juveniles less than 1 cm diameter at breast height. Both the clumps and grasslands occur on uniform calcareous soils. The clumps are thought to be a stage in a succession towards monsoon forest. Field experiments showed that seedlings from a range of monsoon forest and savanna species can grow on the plains. Interpretation of aerial photography taken in 1963 and 1982 suggests that the clumps have expanded. Fire is thought to control the succession. A fire on the plains was found to kill between one and two-thirds of the basal area of Pandanus spiralis and A. auriculiformis and stimulated the establishment of six times more A. auriculiformis seedlings than in nearby unburnt clumps. Monsoon forest juveniles that invade the clumps typically resprout following fire. Stunted, fire-damaged monsoon forest species (e.g. Timonius timon, Alstonia actinophylla) occur in low densities in the grasslands. It is unclear whether banteng promotes the succession by reducing fuel loads in the grasslands and spreading A. auriculiforms seeds.},

This is of particular concern in the five mediterranean regions of the world that are all biodiversity hotspots with extraordinary plant and animal diversity that may be impacted by deliberately imposed fire. Wildland managers attempt to reduce the impact and mitigate the outcomes of wildfires on human assets and biodiversity by the use of prescribed burning. The response that we must ‘fight fire with fire’ is understandable, perceived as reducing the flammability of wildlands in fire-prone regions and lessening the impact of wildfires. The long-term impact on biodiversity is, however, less clear. The practice of prescribed burning has been in place and monitored in south-western Australia for 50 years, longer and more intensively than in most other mediterranean ecosystems. The present target is for 200 000 ha burned each year in this biodiversity hotspot. Published studies on the impact of this burning on infrastructure protection and on biodiversity are here used to understand the protective capacity of the practice and to foreshadow its possible long-term ecological impact across all mediterranean ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Aim Patterns of fire regimes across Australia exhibit biogeographic variation in response to four processes. Variations in area burned and fire frequency result from differences in the rates of ‘switching’ of biomass growth, availability to burn, fire weather and ignition. Therefore differing processes limit fire (i.e. the lowest rate of switching) in differing ecosystems. Current and future trends in fire frequency were explored on this basis. Location Case studies of forests (cool temperate to tropical) and woodlands (temperate to arid) were examined. These represent a broad range of Australian biomes and current fire regimes. Methods Information on the four processes was applied to each case study and the potential minimum length of interfire interval was predicted and compared to current trends. The potential effects of global change on the processes were then assessed and future trends in fire regimes were predicted. Results Variations in fire regimes are primarily related to fluctuations in available moisture and dominance by either woody or herbaceous plant cover. Fire in woodland communities (dry climates) is limited by growth of herbaceous fuels (biomass), whereas in forests (wet climates) limitation is by fuel moisture (availability to burn) and fire weather. Increasing dryness in woodland communities will decrease potential fire frequency, while the opposite applies in forests. In the tropics, both forms of limitation are weak due to the annual wet/dry climate. Future change may therefore be constrained. Main conclusions Increasing dryness may diminish fire activity over much of Australia (dominance of dry woodlands), though increases may occur in temperate forests. Elevated CO2 effects may confound or reinforce these trends. The prognosis for the future fire regime in Australia is therefore uncertain.},

A flatwoods longleaf pine wiregrass ecosystem, which regenerated naturally following wildfire in 1942, on the Coastal Plain of southern Georgia was treated over a period of four decades with prescribed fire at annual, biennial and triennial intervals during the winter dormant season. Burning caused substantial changes in the understory plant community, with significant reductions in the foliar cover of Ilex glabra in the shrub layer resulting in corresponding increases in the cover of Vaccinium myrsinites, Sporobolus curtissii, Aristida stricta and Andropogon spp. Understory plant species richness, diversity and evenness also increased as a result of periodic fire. Dormant-season burning decreased the cover of litter on the forest floor and significantly increased the standing biomass of A. stricta, S. curtissii, Andropogon spp., all other grasses and all forbs. Recurrent fire also prevented the development of a vigorous midstory, that impedes understory growth and poses a serious fire hazard to the stand. Overstory trees were largely unaffected by burning. Historical light grazing on the site produced no measurable effects on the plant community. Findings suggest that the biennial burning interval results in declines of I. glabra in the shrub layer and litter cover on the forest floor, leading to the largest increases in understory plant species richness and diversity and the biomass productivity of grasses and forbs. Although flatwoods plant communities evolved in environments characterized by growing-season fires of variable frequency, long-term application of dormant-season fire is also recommended as a useful option for sustaining resource values in this and similar longleaf pine wiregrass ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes the effects of wildfire on the nesting behaviour of some species of birds in a heathland community at Gooseberry Hill, Western Australia. The most severe fire during the nine year (1981-89) study was a hot summer burn in January 1985, which destroyed 95\% of the study area. In the spring following that fire, 81\% of the species previously known to breed in the area were still able to nest. The nesting substrate, height, site and aspect for three of the most abundant species (splendid fairy-wrens, western thornbills and yellow-rumped thornbills) were examined in detail. In the immediate post-fire year, all three used as nest sites only those plant species which regenerate by sprouting. The mean height of splendid fairy-wren nests in shrubs was lower than in unburnt habitat, although the wrens also built some nests in unusually high sites in trees in the first two seasons after fire. The mean height of western thornbill nests did not change but nest placement in a favoured substrate, Xanthorrhoea preissii, varied according to time since fire. Yellow-rumped thornbill nests built in burnt habitat tended to be higher and in a more restricted range of substrates than previously. Breeding of splendid fairy-wrens was delayed by three to five weeks in the first year after fire and the number of nests built per group had almost doubled by the second season. Only 59\% of adult female western thornbills attempted to nest in the season immediately following the 1985 fire and the onset of breeding in burnt habitat was up to five weeks later than in unburnt. The delay by splendid fairy-wrens and western thornbills was attributed to a shortage of nesting material and adequate food for egg production, respectively, whereas the increase in the number of nests built by splendid fairy-wrens was attributed to a high rate of nest failure. At least two species (white-browed scrubwren and white-cheeked honeyeater) did not nest for two years after the 1985 fire and Acanthiza apicalis has not nested up to the present time (five years). The fire-modified habitat appeared beneficial to little button-quail and elegant parrot, which nested on the study area only after fire. White-winged triller and dusky woodswallow were more numerous breeders after fire than previously. Our findings highlight the importance of detailed long-term studies for estimating adequate fire-free intervals necessary for the conservation of resident avian species. A minimum period of at least 10 years is suggested for heathlands of south-western Australia.},

  abstract = {Ecotones are boundaries between plant assemblages that can represent a physiological or competitive limit of species’ local distributions, usually through one or more biotic or abiotic constraints on species’ resource requirements. However, ecotones also result from the effects of chronic or episodic disturbances, and changes in disturbance regimes may have profound effects on vegetation patterns in transitional areas. In this study, centuries-long chronologies of surface fire events were reconstructed from fire-scarred ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) trees in three sites at the ecotone between ponderosa pine forest and Northern Great Plains mixed-grass prairie in the southeastern Black Hills of South Dakota. The fire chronologies provide baseline data to assess the possible role of fire in this transitional area and to document historical variability in fire regimes in this region of the Northern Great Plains. Regular fire events were recorded at all three sites from the beginning of the fire chronologies in the 1500s up to the late 1800s or early 1900s, at which time spreading fires ceased. Fire frequencies derived from the fire chronologies were compared to each other and to four sites from interior ponderosa pine forest in the south-central Black Hills. Mean fire intervals at the savanna sites were between 10 to 12 years, whereas Weibull median probability intervals were one year shorter. Fire frequency at the savanna sites was twice as high as at the interior forest sites, and most likely was due to spatial extent of fires on the mixed-grass prairie coupled with warmer and drier climate regime. Post-settlement shifts in the ponderosa pine savanna during the twentieth century in this area may be largely attributed to lack of fire occurrences, although grazing and other factors also likely contributed to observed changes in forest and grassland margins.},

  abstract     = {The objectives of this study were to understand the role of fires on land-cover changes, and conversely the role of vegetation cover as a controlling factor of fires. The study, which was conducted in a region at the savannah/forest transition in the southwestern part of the Central African Republic, explores the differential impact on land cover of early- and late-season fires and analyses burning regimes as a function of human use of the land. This was addressed using multivariate regression models between maps of land-cover change derived from remote sensing data, maps of burnt areas and a detailed map of ecotypes. In dense forests, burning is strongly associated with land-cover changes, while in savannahs the occurrence of (mostly) early fires does not lead to land-cover change. Fires associated with continuous and fragmented burnt patches have similar impacts on vegetation cover. Dense semi-humid forests in the study area were affected by a high level of burning due to land uses at their peripheries. The results confirm recent findings concerning human control on the timing of burning in savannahs. Early fires fragment the landscape and prevent the spatial diffusion of later damaging fires. Where no human settlements are present, late fires become more prevalent. Finally, the study measured an increase in vegetation cover in a few areas affected by very early burning. Using burnt area rather than active fire data allowed a better analysis of the spatial association between landscape attributes and burning events.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is generally assumed, but rarely tested, that determinants of ANPP in one region within a biome will operate similarly throughout that biome, as long as physiognomy and climate are broadly consistent. We tested this assumption by quantifying ANPP responses to fire, grazing history, and nitrogen (N) addition in North American (NA) and South African (SA) savanna grasslands. We found that total ANPP responded in generally consistent ways to fire, grazing history, and N addition on both continents. Annual fire in both NA and SA consistently stimulated total ANPP (28–100\%) relative to unburned treatments at sites with deep soils, and had no effect on ANPP in sites with shallow soils. Fire did not affect total ANPP in sites with a recent history of grazing, regardless of whether a single or a diverse suite of large herbivores was present. N addition interacted strongly and consistently with fire regime in both NA and SA. In annually burned sites that were not grazed, total ANPP was stimulated by N addition (29–39\%), but there was no effect of N fertilization in the absence of fire. In contrast, responses in forb ANPP to fire and grazing were somewhat divergent across this biome. Annual fire in NA reduced forb ANPP, whereas grazing increased forb ANPP, but neither response was evident in SA. Thus, despite a consistent response in total ANPP, divergent responses in forb ANPP suggest that other aspects of community structure and ecosystem functioning differ in important ways between these mesic savanna grasslands.},

  abstract = {The effects of two acute stresses, mowing and burning, on the arthropod component of an experimental grassland ecosystem were investigated. Oats (Avena sativa L.) were planted in two comparable and adjacent 1—acre areas. Midway in the growing season (July), one area was mowed and the other areas was both mowed and burned. Density and biomass were used to measure the effects of both stresses on the total arthropod community, while species diversity and equitability were used to analyze the species composition and apportionment of the Coleoptera. Effects of mowing on arthropod density and biomass appeared to be relatively brief (2 weeks) as compared with those of burning (3 months). This difference was attributed to a shift from live primary producer energy to detritus in the mowed area, as compared to the almost complete destruction of the energy source in the burned area. Coleoptera species/area diversity was significantly lower (P {$<$} 0.01) in the burned area. This was attributed to a greater energy supply and a larger number of ecological niches in the unburned grid. Margalef's species diversity, D = (S—1)/1nN, for the total Coleoptera community was significantly reduced (P {$<$} 0.05) in response to the fire. When analyzed by trophic levels on a long—term basis, herbivorous Coleoptera species diversity was significantly reduced (P {$<$} 0.01), whereas that of the carnivorous Coleoptera was not measurably affected. Herbivorous Coleoptera equitability values, in response to mowing, exhibited a brief increase before returning to the premow level. In response to burning, however, herbivorous Coleoptera equitability values remained higher than those in the unburned area, indicating a longterm limitation of resources. Carnivore equitability values did not exhibit a long—term increase in response to the fire stress.

  abstract     = {The biogeochemical and stoichiometric signature of vegetation fire may influence post-fire ecosystem characteristics and the evolution of plant ‘fire traits’. Phosphorus (P), a potentially limiting nutrient in many fire-prone environments, might be particularly important in this context; however, the effects of fire on P cycling often vary widely. We conducted a global-scale meta-analysis using data from 174 soil studies and 39 litter studies, and found that fire led to significantly higher concentrations of soil mineral P as well as significantly lower soil and litter carbon:P and nitrogen:P ratios. These results demonstrate that fire has a P-rich signature in the soil–plant system that varies with vegetation type. Further, they suggest that burning can ease P limitation and decouple the biogeochemical cycling of P, carbon and nitrogen. These effects resemble a transient reversion to an earlier stage of ecosystem development, and likely underpin at least some of fire’s impacts on ecosystems and organisms.},

No other cause of wildfire has experienced this level of decline. For 12 states, we evaluate the rate of smoking-caused wildfires and find it is a function of weather, other ignitions, the number of adult smokers, the presence of improved wildfire cause-determination methods, and whether a state required the sale of less fire-prone cigarettes. We find the decline in adult smoking rates has led to a reduction of smoking-caused fires by 9\%. The finding that less fire-prone cigarettes appear successful at limiting wildfire starts – by 23\% – is a likely unintended benefit of a technology aimed at reducing fire fatalities in residences. We also find that the improvements in wildfire cause determination have resulted in a reduction in smoking-classified fires by 48\%. Although improved wildfire cause-determination methods do not necessarily reduce the number of wildfires, they ensure that the causes of wildfire are accurately tracked. Accurate wildfire cause determination can, however, result in targeting wildfire-prevention programs to specific fire-cause categories, which can lead to a reduction in the overall number of wildfires.},

The present paper examines historic and contemporary uses of fire as a land management tool among Maasai pastoralists in northern Tanzania and explores the potential impacts of changing fire management and fire suppression on savanna vegetation. Village members were interviewed about historical and current practices, reasons for burning, the history of land use, and their perceptions of fire. Eight recent burn sites were selected for examination of size, ignition source, and timing of the burn. The Maasai identified eight major reasons for using fire on a landscape scale in savannas and historically used a progression of small fires throughout the dry season as grasses cured to create a fragmented burn pattern and to prevent large, catastrophic late-season fires. Currently, there is little active vegetation management using fire largely owing to federal fire suppression policies, unpredictable rainfall patterns, increasing population pressures, and a subsequent increase in the number of catastrophic accidental fires. Substantial modifications to historical fire regimes could have cascading consequences for savanna health by increasing late-season fuel loads and the occurrence of large, catastrophic fires.},

  abstract     = {Measurements of community resemblance in ecology are often based on species composition, and the starting point for calculations is usually a site-by-species data table. However, resemblance measurements may not be sufficiently accurate when communities are described using species composition only. Characteristics such as the size of their constituting organisms are also important to understand community organization. Here, we provide a framework that generalizes conventional resemblance measurements by incorporating the size structure of the compared communities. We first introduce the concept of cumulative abundance profile, which generalizes traditional species abundance values, and describe how to calculate it. We then explain our approach to compare cumulative abundance profiles in community resemblance measurements and use a small simulation study to determine which resemblance coefficients appropriately deal with compositional and structural differences. After that, we present an illustrative example where we study the structural and compositional variation between and within six Douglas-fir forest plots in British Columbia, Canada. According to our investigations, the generalizations we suggest for the percentage difference (alias Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) and the Ružička coefficients are appropriate to measure community resemblance in terms of size structure, species composition or both. Our framework allows community resemblance to be measured in terms of either size structure or species composition, or both. A broad range of applications is expected. In the case of terrestrial plant communities, potential applications include analyses of community dynamics and classification of vegetation.},

  abstract     = {Fire is the dominant factor affecting C and N losses from the semiarid forests of the eastern Sierra Nevada. As prescription fire becomes a best management practice, it is critical to develop an estimate of these fluxes. The objectives of this study were (i) to test and refine methods to estimate the volatilized C and N losses from the forest floor following fire, (ii) to investigate the interactions between O-horizon temperature and nutrient loss, and (iii) to assess measured N losses in the context of atmospheric N deposition, leaching, and N fixation. The quantities of C and N volatilized from the forest floor by prescription fire in the Sierra Nevada were measured using two different field-based methods: weight loss estimation and Ca/element ratio determination. Three sites were included in the study: Marlene, Sawtooth and Spooner. The weight method indicated C losses of 6.12, 7.39, and 17.8 Mg C haϪ1 at the Sawtooth, Marlene, and Spooner sites, respectively. The ratio method indicated comparable C losses from the Sawtooth (6 Mg C haϪ1 ) site, but greater losses at Marlene (16 Mg C haϪ1 ) and Spooner (24 Mg C haϪ1 ) sites. The weight method indicated N losses of 56.2, 60.8, and 362 kg N haϪ1, at the Sawtooth, Marlene, and Spooner sites, respectively. The ratio method indicated comparable N losses of 59.9 kg N haϪ1 at the Sawtooth site, but considerably greater losses at Marlene (243 kg N haϪ1 ), and Spooner (524 kg N haϪ1 ) sites. The Ca-element method was preferred because of minimal needs for preburn sampling. Regardless of method, the estimated losses were significant, particularly for N, compared with deposition and leaching rates. Volatilization will represent the major mechanism for N loss from forest ecosystems of this region subjected to prescribed fire.},

Measurements of temperature and water content in a soil column that was heated strongly at the surface showed a consistent pattern of warming and drying. In initially wet soil, temperature rose to around 95°C and remained there until the water content of the soil at that depth dropped below about 0.02 m3 m3. When the soil was initially dry, the temperature increased more rapidly, but even the moisture present in air-dry soil was sufficient to slow the rate of temperature rise when temperatures reached 90°C. A linked-transport model, which simultaneously computes changes in temperature and water content, simulated the main features of heat and water flow in a soil column heated to high temperature. There were no consistent deviations of measured from modeled temperatures, but the water content simulations consistently showed a greater buildup of moisture ahead of the heating front than did the measurements, and less drying of the soil in the heated layers when the initial soil water content was low. Soils from sand to clay, and with differing mineralogies, water contents, and bulk densities were used to compare measurements and simulations. The model performed well in all cases. Since the temperature simulations are reasonable, the model appears suitable for predicting fire effects in the field.},

  abstract     = {Despite the abundance of serotinous species in southwestern Australia, demonstration of the enhancement of fitness through fire, by releasing seeds onto an optimal postfire seedbed for seedling establishment, rather than following drought death, has not been explicitly explored. In this study, we measured seed release, germination and seedling recruitment following plant death after fire and simulated drought among six serotinous species in southwestern Australia. Burning or heating the cones/fruits resulted in a marked increase in follicle opening (pyriscence) compared with plant death from drought (necriscence) among Banksia but not Hakea. We recorded higher rates of germination, lower seedling mortality and better seedling growth in the post-fire environments than in unburnt sites not burnt for at least 10 years for five species (seeds of the sixth species were non-viable). Seedling mortality among the five species of 100 \% occurred in the unburnt plots over the first summer, while 28–79 \% of seedlings survived in the burnt plots. Soil moisture measurements indicated much lower water availability in the unburnt sites even in spring. Our study provides strong empirical evidence that serotiny/pyriscence enhances species fitness by releasing seeds into an optimal post-fire habitat in contrast to that observed from plant/crown death due to drought. In the context of the long history of fire in southwestern Australia, the greatly enhanced fitness in response to fire rather than severe drought supports the proposition that serotiny is a specific adaptation to fire.},

  abstract = {Fire can create, strengthen or destroy soil water repellency, with potential implications for soil infiltration, surface runoff and erosion. Laboratory studies suggest fire-induced changes to water repellency relate to soil temperatures during the burn. However, relations between temperature and repellency are rarely tested in the field where spatial variations in fuel type, soil type and soil moisture may lead to more complex responses to fire. Furthermore, few studies link point-scale water repellency measurements to hydro-geomorphic effects at larger spatial scales. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to (1) measure soil temperatures during prescribed burns, (2) investigate the in-situ effects of soil heating on soil water repellency and (3) investigate the subsequent effects of soil water repellency on infiltration, runoff and erosion. Heat-sensitive liquids and thermocouples measured soil temperatures at points within three prescribed burns. Soil water repellency and infiltration were measured at the same burnt points and at adjacent unburnt points 2–6 weeks post-burn. Rainfall simulations quantified plot-scale infiltration, surface runoff and erosion at one site. Peak temperatures at the surface were highly variable (averaging 238, 129 and 327 °C at each burn) while sub-surface temperatures were lower (averaging 75, less than79 and 108 °C at each burn). Heating durations were short with surface temperatures greater than 400 °C lasting on average for 2 s and temperatures greater than 200 °C lasting on average for 6 s. Despite preexisting water repellency in unburnt areas, water repellency was strengthened in burnt areas at two sites. High temperatures were associated with more repellency, even when the temperatures exceeded laboratory-defined thresholds for the destruction of water repellency. Short heating durations may explain why the laboratorydefined temperature thresholds were not applicable in the field. Point-scale steady-state infiltration rates were significantly lower for burnt compared with unburnt areas, reflecting the greater water repellency. However, other factors (e.g. macropore flow, soil sealing and reduced vegetation cover) are also likely to have caused unexpectedly high or low infiltration rates for some points and higher infiltration rates at the plot-scale than expected. The relative importance of water repellency to infiltration, surface runoff and erosion appeared to vary depending on the spatial scale of measurement. These issues of scale together with the apparent spatial heterogeneity of prescribed burnt landscapes warrant the use of connectivity modelling as a way to link point and plot scale measures to impacts at larger spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties can be affected by forest fires. The effects are chiefly a result of burn severity, which consists of peak temperatures and duration of the fire. Climate, vegetation, and topography of the burnt area control the resilience of the soil system; some fire-induced changes can even be permanent. Low to moderate severity fires, such as most of those prescribed in forest management, promote renovation of the dominant vegetation through elimination of undesired species and transient increase of pH and available nutrients. No irreversible ecosystem change occurs, but the enhancement of hydrophobicity can render the soil less able to soak up water and more prone to erosion. Severe fires, such as wildfires, generally have several negative effects on soil. They cause significant removal of organic matter, deterioration of both structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilisation, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, and marked alteration of both quantity and specific composition of microbial and soil-dwelling invertebrate communities. However, despite common perceptions, if plants succeed in promptly recolonising the burnt area, the pre-fire level of most properties can be recovered and even enhanced. This work is a review of the up-to-date literature dealing with changes imposed by fires on properties of forest soils. Ecological implications of these changes are described.},

  abstract     = {The contact zone between human infrastructure and wildland vegetation, known as the wildlandeurban interface (WUI), has increased worldwide over the last decades and has a direct relationship with the risk of forest fires. Human activities increase the likelihood of wildfires, which can have disastrous consequences for property and land use and can pose a serious threat to lives. This paper examines the spatial patterns of the WUI and wildfire ignition points in Galicia (NW, Spain). We spatially delimited and classified WUI areas by the intensity of human presence, using the spatial arrangement of buildings. We also classified the areas by forest fragmentation and then explored the statistical differences in the density of forest-fire ignitions among areas in the different WUI categories. The study area in Galicia has the highest rate of wildfire incidents in Spain. Our results show that more than half of the built area is located in the WUI and that fire ignition is approximately twice as frequent in WUI as in non-WUI areas. The highest wildfire occurrence is in unforested areas of the WUI, while the lowest fire density is associated with isolated buildings. Areas with very dense clusters of buildings surrounded by forestland, characterized here as peri-urban areas, have the highest density of fire ignition. This trend highlights the vulnerability of the interface to fire in this region. Particularly in high risk areas, our work can advance spatial delimitation policies and further the development and promotion of plans for the protection of human lives, property and economic activity.},

  abstract = {In fire-prone regions, wildfire influences spatial and temporal patterns of landscape heterogeneity. The likely impacts of climate change on the frequency and intensity of wildfire highlights the importance of understanding how fire-induced heterogeneity may affect different components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal mammals in fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia. First, we used a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of arboreal mammals 2–3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence, with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt and understorey-only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve as refuges for fauna in the post-fire environment and assist recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate spatial aspects of fire regimes (e.g., creation and protection of refuges) for fire management in fire-prone landscapes.},

Seed germination was greatly stimulated in several species by heat. Seedling growth was enhanced by nutrient enrichment similar to that observed in burned chaparral. Animal grazing had drastic effects on seedling survival. None of the seedlings exposed to animal grazing survived. Growth under the shrub cover was apparently suppressed, even in fertilized plots, by shrub-derived toxins and decreased light levels. No single factor can, by itself, account for the entire pattern of germination and growth of all species beneath Adenostoma. The environmental complex under the shrub cover is such that the probability of survival of any single seedling is very low. These selective forces have resulted in the evolution of very efficient seed dormancy mechanisms in several species.},

The ground-based data to monitor such trends in fire activity are inadequate at the global scale. Satellite observations provide a basis for such a monitoring system. In this study, a set of metrics were developed from 6 years of MODIS active fire data. The metrics were grouped into eight classes representing three axes of fire activity: density, season duration and interannual variability. These groups were compared with biophysical and human explanatory variables on a global scale. We found that more than 30\% of the land surface has a significant fire frequency. The most extensive fire class exhibited high fire density, low duration and high variability and was found in boreal and tropical wet and dry environments. A high association was found between population distribution and fire persistence. Low GDP kmÀ2 was associated with fire classes with high interannual variability and low seasonal duration. In areas with more economic resources, fires tend to be more regular and last longer. High fire duration and low interannual variability were associated with croplands, but often with low fire density. The study was constrained by the limited length of satellite data record but is a first step toward developing a comprehensive global assessment of fire regimes. However, more attention is needed by the global observing systems to provide the underpinning socio-economic observations to better quantify and analyze the human characteristics of fire regimes.},

  abstract = {A stochastic model of plant population dynamics is developed and analyzed to determine how density and age structure depend on thinning rates and disturbance regimes. Probability distributions of age and density are derived from the distribution of regeneration niches on a landscape and the thinning rates of cohorts on patches created by adult mortality or larger disturbances. The theory is then extended to different types of disturbances that operate at different scales and are interdependent, such as treefalls that only become important as the early-successional trees that initially colonize an area affected by a larger scale disturbance become mature.},

  abstract     = {Variation in population dynamics is inherently related to life history characteristics of species, which vary markedly even within phylogenetic groups such as passerine birds. We computed the finite rate of population change (λ) from a matrix projection model and from mark-recapture observations for 23 bird species breeding in northern Arizona. We used sensitivity analyses and a simulation model to separate contributions of different life history traits to population growth rate. In particular we focused on contrasting effects of components of reproduction (nest success, clutch size, number of clutches, and juvenile survival) versus adult survival on λ. We explored how changes in nest success or adult survival coupled to costs in other life history parameters affected λ over a life history gradient provided by our 23 Arizona species, as well as a broader sample of 121 North American passerine species. We further examined these effects for more than 200 passeriform and piciform populations breeding across North America. Model simulations indicate nest success and juvenile survival exert the largest effects on population growth in species with moderate to high reproductive output, whereas adult survival contributed more to population growth in long-lived species. Our simulations suggest that monitoring breeding success in populations across a broad geographic area provides an important index for identifying neotropical migratory populations at risk of serious population declines and a potential method for identifying large-scale mechanisms regulating population dynamics.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution projections of climate change impacts on fire weather conditions in southeast Australia out to 2080 are presented. Fire weather is represented by the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), calculated from an objectively designed regional climate model ensemble. Changes in annual cumulative FFDI vary widely, from − 337 (− 21\%) to + 657 (+ 24\%) in coastal areas and − 237 (− 12\%) to + 1143 (+ 26\%) in inland areas. A similar spread is projected in extreme FFDI values. In coastal regions, the number of prescribed burning days is projected to change from − 11 to + 10 in autumn and − 10 to + 3 in spring. Across the ensemble, the most significant increases in fire weather and decreases in prescribed burn windows are projected to take place in spring. Partial bias correction of FFDI leads to similar projections but with a greater spread, particularly in extreme values. The partially bias-corrected FFDI performs similarly to uncorrected FFDI compared to the observed annual cumulative FFDI (ensemble root mean square error spans 540 to 1583 for uncorrected output and 695 to 1398 for corrected) but is generally worse for FFDI values above 50. This emphasizes the need to consider inter-variable relationships when bias-correcting for complex phenomena such as fire weather. There is considerable uncertainty in the future trajectory of fire weather in southeast Australia, including the potential for less prescribed burning days and substantially greater fire danger in spring. Selecting climate models on the basis of multiple criteria can lead to more informative projections and allow an explicit exploration of uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Despite the importance of prescribed burning in contemporary fire management, there is little understanding of how climate change will influence the weather conditions under which it is deployed. We provide quantitative estimates of potential changes in the number of prescribed burning days in coastal NSW in south-eastern Australia, a fire-prone area dominated by dry sclerophyll forests. Burning days are calculated from an objectively designed regional climate model ensemble using three definitions of suitable weather conditions based on: a literature search (Literature), actual weather observed during recorded prescribed burns (Observed) and operational guidelines (Operational). Contrary to some claims, evidence for a decrease in prescribed burning days under projected future climates is weak. We found a complex pattern of changes, with the potential for substantial and widespread increases in the current burning seasons of autumn (March-May) and spring (AugustOctober). Projected changes were particularly uncertain in northern NSW, spanning substantial increases and decreases during autumn. The magnitude of projected changes in the frequency of burning days was highly sensitive to which definition of suitable weather conditions was used, with a relatively small change for the Operational definition (+0.3 to +1.9 days per year across the study area) and larger ranges for the Observed (+0.2 to +7.9 days) and Literature (+1.7 to +6.2 days) definitions. Interannual variability in the number of burning days is projected to increase slightly under projected climate change. Our study highlights the need for a better understanding of the weather conditions required for safe and effective prescribed burning. Our analysis provides practitioners with quantitative information to assess their exposure to a range of potential changes in the frequency, seasonality and variability of prescribed burning weather conditions.},

  abstract     = {A simple field experiment was conducted to measure and quantify fire–atmosphere interactions during a grass fire spreading up a hill under a moderate cross-slope wind. The observed fire intensity measured by passive radiometers and calculated sensible heat fluxes ranged between 90 and 120 kW m−2. Observations from this experiment showed that convective heat generated from the fire front was transported downwind in the lowest 2 m and the highest plume temperatures remained in this shallow layer, suggesting the fire spread was driven primarily by the advection of near-ignition temperature gases, rather than by radiation of the tilted flame. Fire-induced circulations were present with upslope flows occurring during the fire-front passage helping to transport heat up the slope and perpendicular to the fire front. A decrease in atmospheric pressure of 0.4 hPa occurred at the fire front and coincided with a strong updraft core of nearly 8 m s−1. These observations provide evidence that, even under moderately windy conditions, the pressure minimum in the fire remains rather close to the combustion zone and plume. The turbulence associated with the fire front was characterized by isotropic behaviour at 12.0 m above the ground, while less isotropic conditions were found closer to the ground due to higher horizontal variances associated with fire-induced flow at the fire front. From analysis of the turbulence kinetic energy budget terms, it was found that buoyancy production, rather than shear generation, had a larger contribution to the generation of turbulence kinetic energy, even during a highly sheared and moderate ambient wind.},

  abstract     = {Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) constitutes a significant fraction of organic carbon in most soils.However, PyC soil stocks are generally smaller than what is expected from estimates of PyC produced fromfire and decomposition losses, implying that other processes cause PyC loss from soils. Surface erosion hasbeen previously suggested as one such process. To address this, following a large wildfire in the RockyMountains (CO, USA), we tracked PyC from the litter layer and soil, through eroded, suspended, and dissolvedsolids to alluvial deposits along riversides. We separated deposited sediment into high- and low-densityfractions to identify preferential forms of PyC transport and quantified PyC in all samples and densityfractions using benzene polycarboxylic acid markers. A few months after thefire, PyC had yet to movevertically into the mineral soil and remained in the organic layer or had been transported off site by rainfalldriven overlandflow. During major storm events PyC was associated with suspended sediments in river waterand later identified in low-density riverbank deposits. Flows from an unusually long-duration and highmagnitude rainstorm either removed or buried the riverbank sediments approximately 1 year after theirdeposition. We conclude that PyC redistributes after wildfire in patterns that are consistent with erosion anddeposition of low-density sediments. A more complete understanding of PyC dynamics requires attention tothe interaction of postfire precipitation patterns and geomorphological features that control surface erosionand deposition throughout the watershe},

  abstract = {Fire-use and the scale and character of its effects on landscapes remain hotly debated in the paleoand historical-fire literature. Since the second half of the nineteenth century, anthropology and geography have played important roles in providing theoretical propositions and testable hypotheses for advancing understandings of the ecological role of human–fire-use in landscape histories. This article reviews some of the most salient and persistent theoretical propositions and hypotheses concerning the role of humans in historical fire ecology. The review discusses this history in light of current research agendas, such as those offered by pyrogeography. The review suggests that a more theoretically cognizant historical fire ecology should strive to operationalize transdisciplinary theory capable of addressing the role of human variability in the evolutionary history of landscapes. To facilitate this process, researchers should focus attention on integrating more current human ecology theory into transdisciplinary research agendas.},

Increases in the frequency and intensity of wildfires due to anthropogenic activity or future changes in the global climate are suspected to impact heavily on components of the biota in fire-dependent landscapes, but there is almost no knowledge of how changes to fire regimes interact with other stressors such as drying environments. We used livetrapping techniques to investigate the effects of wildfire and drought on the abundance of 3 species of small mammals in coastal woodland in southeastern Australia. We used a generalized linear mixed effects model design to compare 4 years of post-fire trapping results with pre-fire data on both burned and unburned sites. Numbers of all small mammal species were declining due to drought prior to an extensive wildfire. Wildfire significantly exacerbated the decline in abundance of small mammals in the year after fire. A return to wetter climatic conditions was accompanied by a recovery in small mammal numbers, which was faster in unburned sites than burned sites. Our results demonstrate a strong linkage between climatic conditions, fire, and mammal assemblages, and emphasize the need for long-term research to disentangle the interactive effects of these factors on wildlife.},

  abstract     = {To test the hypothesis that wildfire smoke can cool summer river and stream water temperatures by attenuating solar radiation and air temperature, we analyzed data on summer wildfire smoke, solar radiation, air temperatures, precipitation, river discharge, and water temperatures in the lower Klamath River Basin in Northern California. Previous studies have focused on the effect of combustion heat on water temperatures during fires and the effect of riparian vegetation losses on postfire water temperatures, but we know of no studies of the effects of wildfire smoke on river or stream water temperatures. Wildfire smoke is difficult to quantify, but we successfully used a newly available daily high-resolution (1 km) data set of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) derived from satellite imagery to represent smoke density during 6 years with extensive wildfire activity (2006, 2008, and 2012–2015). Smoke reduced solar radiation by 121 W m 2 per 1.0 AOT relative to clear-sky conditions. Linear mixed-effects models showed that on average, smoke cooled daily maximum and mean air temperatures by 0.98 °C and 0.47 °C per 1.0 AOT, respectively, across 19 remote automated weather stations. Smoke had a cooling effect on water temperatures at all 12 river and stream locations analyzed. On average, smoke cooled daily maximum and mean water temperatures by 1.32 °C and 0.74 °C per 1.0 AOT, respectively. This smoke-induced cooling has the potential to benefit cold-water adapted species, particularly because wildfires are more likely to occur during the warmest and driest years and seasons.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Ecosystem engineers are species that have a role in creating and maintaining certain habitat traits that are important for other species. Burrowing species do this by creating subterranean refugia from predation and thermal extremes, but also providing foraging opportunities through soil movement and by increasing local landscape heterogeneity. In this study, we used camera traps to monitor the burrows of greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis), a vulnerable Australian marsupial, in an area subject to frequent disturbance by fire. We tested the hypothesis that bilby burrows provide refuge for other species and therefore their presence increases biodiversity. In total, 45 taxa ? 22 bird, 16 reptile and 7 mammal taxa ? were recorded interacting with 127 burrows across 7 sites. Species richness was greater at burrows compared with vegetation away from burrows, while abundance was no different. There was no difference in species assemblage for bilby burrows that were actively maintained by bilbies compared with abandoned burrows, although there was more activity at bilby maintained burrows. A wildfire allowed us to test the ad hoc hypothesis that the use of bilby burrows was greater when vegetation cover was removed by fire. We recorded significant differences in species assemblage interacting with burrows after fire, although overall species richness and abundance did not change. The response of individual species was variable; for example, burrows provide a refuge for smaller species (such as mice and small reptiles), and may therefore protect them from the effects of fire. Where they persist, bilbies provide an important ecosystem engineering service, as their burrows support a broad range of species. Further reduction in the distribution of the bilby is therefore likely to have a flow-on effect on biodiversity, impacting species that use their burrows for refuge.},

  abstract     = {Fuel characteristics play an important role in driving fire ignition and propagation; at the landscape scale fuel availability and flammability are closely related to vegetation phenology. In this view, the NDVI profiles obtained from high temporal resolution satellites, like MODIS, are an effective tool for monitoring the coarse-scale vegetation seasonal timing. The aim of this paper is twofold: our first objective consists in classifying by means of multitemporal NDVI profiles the coarse-scale vegetation of Sardinia into ‘phenological clusters’ in which fire incidence is higher (preferred) or lower (avoided) than expected from a random null model. If fires would burn unselectively, then fires would occur randomly across the landscape such that the number of fires in a given phenological cluster would be nearly proportional to the relative area of that land cover type in the analyzed landscape. Actually, certain vegetation types are more fire-prone than others. That is, they are burnt more frequently than others. In this framework, our second objective consists in investigating the temporal parameters of the remotely sensed NDVI profiles that best characterize the observed phenology–fire selectivity relationship. The results obtained show a good association between the NDVI temporal profiles and the spatio-temporal wildfire distribution in Sardinia, emphasizing the role of bioclimatic timing in driving fire regime characteristics.},

The thickness of the water repellent layer in the underlying test soil increased as per cent silt and clay decreased. The thickest and most intensely water repellent layer was produced in a uniform 35-mesh sand. The effect of texture on water repellency was attributed to large differences in specific surfaces of the soils which ranged from 0.0077 to 55 m2/g. The induced water repellency was not directly related to a given amount of organic matter translocated by the heat treatment. Generally, however, the degree of water repellency increased as the amount of translocated organic matter increased in a given test soil.},

  abstract     = {Fire disturbance is a primary driver of forest dynamics across the circumpolar boreal region, although there are major differences in continental fire regimes. Relatively infrequent, high intensity crown fires dominate North American boreal forests, and low to moderate intensity surface fires of moderate frequency are typical of northern Asia boreal forests. Climate change will result in future altered fire regimes, which will be realized through changes in fire weather, fire behaviour and C emissions. The impacts of climate change on 2091–2100 fire regimes were simulated in two large boreal study areas in central Russia and western Canada using three global climate models (CGCM3.1, HadCM3 and IPSLCM4) and three climate change scenarios (A1B, A2 and B1). The severity of future fire weather conditions increased in both study areas but was more extreme in the Canadian study area. The CGCM model and the B1 scenario indicated the smallest increases, and the IPSL model and the A2 scenario indicated the greatest increases. Daily Severity Rating (DSR) and head fire intensity (HFI), which are indicators of fire control difficulty, increased in both boreal regions but were more extreme in western Canada. DSR seasonally peaked near the middle of the fire season in both regions at levels much higher than currently experienced. HFI similarly peaked at extreme levels in the late spring or early summer in central Russia. In western Canada, HFI peaked once in the spring at its most extreme level, and again in the late summer at a slightly lower extreme level. Fuel consumption rate changed very little in central Russia, but it increased in western Canada and exhibited a seasonal increasing trend as fuels dried out as the fire season progressed. There was a higher C emissions rate for fires in western Canada, but total C emissions were higher in central Russia due to the greater amount of annual area burned. Future changes in the fire regime will affect forest composition as some species will be favoured over others by fire ecology traits. Fire management will be challenged in the future by increased fire weather severity that could push current suppression capacity beyond a tipping point, resulting in a substantial increase in large fires.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Internationally, severe wildfires are an escalating problem
likely to worsen given projected changes to climate. Hazard reduction burns
(HRBs) are used to suppress wildfire occurrences, but they generate
considerable emissions of atmospheric fine particulate matter, which
depend upon prevailing atmospheric conditions, and can degrade air quality.
Our objectives are to improve understanding of the relationships between
meteorological conditions and air quality during HRBs in Sydney, Australia.
We identify the primary meteorological covariates linked to high PM\textsubscript{2.5}
pollution (particulates \&amp;lt;\&amp;thinsp;2.5\&amp;thinsp;µm in diameter) and quantify
differences in their behaviours between HRB days when PM\textsubscript{2.5} remained
low versus HRB days when PM\textsubscript{2.5} was high. Generalised additive mixed
models were applied to continuous meteorological and PM\textsubscript{2.5} observations
for 2011–2016 at four sites across Sydney. The results show that planetary
boundary layer height (PBLH) and total cloud cover were the most consistent
predictors of elevated PM\textsubscript{2.5} during HRBs. During HRB days with low
pollution, the PBLH between 00:00 and 07:00\&amp;thinsp;LT (local time) was 100–200\&amp;thinsp;m
higher than days with high pollution. The PBLH was similar during
10:00–17:00\&amp;thinsp;LT for both low and high pollution days, but higher after
18:00\&amp;thinsp;LT for HRB days with low pollution. Cloud cover, temperature and wind
speed reflected the above pattern, e.g. mean temperatures and wind speeds
were 2\&amp;thinsp;\textsuperscript{∘}C cooler and 0.5\&amp;thinsp;m\&amp;thinsp;s\textsuperscript{−1} lower during mornings and
evenings of HRB days when air quality was poor. These cooler, more stable
morning and evening conditions coincide with nocturnal westerly cold air
drainage flows in Sydney, which are associated with reduced mixing height and
vertical dispersion, leading to the build-up of PM\textsubscript{2.5}. These findings
indicate that air pollution impacts may be reduced by altering the timing of
HRBs by conducting them later in the morning (by a matter of hours). Our
findings support location-specific forecasts of the air quality impacts of
HRBs in Sydney and similar regions elsewhere.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Land management agencies have responded by increasing the use of prescribed fire and thinning. However, given the continued emphasis on fire suppression, current levels of funding for such fuel management practices are unlikely to maintain the status quo, let alone reverse the effects of fire exclusion. We suggest an alternative approach to wildfire management, one that places less emphasis on suppression and instead encourages managers to balance short-term wildfire damages against the long-term consequences of fire exclusion. However, any major change in wildfire management, such as the one proposed here, will shift the costs and benefits of wildfire management, inevitably raising opposition.},

Atmospheric responses to this extreme fire event are investigated here with a focus on convective processes associated with fire activity (i.e., pyroconvection). We examine six different fire complexes on Black Saturday, finding three clearly distinct pyrocumulonimbus storms, the largest of which reached heights of 15 km on that day and generated hundreds of lightning strokes. The first lightning stroke was recorded near the largest fire complex 5 h after fire ignition. One of the pyrocumulonimbus storms was initiated close to midnight due to mesoscale influences, consistent with extreme fire behavior observed at that time for that particular fire. As another example of fire-atmosphere interactions, a fire that started late on Black Saturday is examined in relation to ignition caused by pyrogenic lightning, with implications for understanding the maximum rate of spread of a wildfire. Results are discussed in relation to another pyrocumulonimbus event associated with the 2003 Canberra fires. Our findings are intended to provide a greater understanding of pyroconvection and fire-atmosphere feedback processes, as well as help enhance wildfire response capabilities. We also demonstrate the potential for using lightning, radar, and satellite remote sensing in combination with thermodynamic analyses as well as synoptic and mesoscale dynamics to provide enhanced real-time guidance for dangerous fire conditions associated with pyroconvection, as well as for the risk of new fire ignitions from pyrogenic lightning. Plain Language Summary A number of devastating wildfires occurred in southeast Australia on 7 February 2009, colloquially known as Black Saturday. Atmospheric responses to this extreme fire event are investigated here with a focus on convective processes associated with fire activity (i.e., pyroconvection). We show that multiple fire plumes produced a number of distinct pyrocumulonimbus storms, some of which reached heights of 15 km on that day and generated a large amount of lightning. The first lightning stroke was recorded near the largest fire complex 5 h after fire ignition. This offers broad implications for understanding fire behavior exacerbation rates, given that deep convection can produce extreme variations in surface wind conditions. A fire that started late on Black Saturday is examined in relation to ignition caused by pyrogenic lightning, 100 km ahead of the fire front, with implications for understanding extreme fire spread rates. Our findings are intended to provide a greater understanding of pyroconvection and fire-atmosphere feedback processes, as well as help enhance wildfire response capabilities. We also demonstrate the potential for combining lightning and radar data to provide real-time guidance for dangerous fire conditions associated with pyroconvection, as well as for the risk of new fire ignitions from pyrogenic lightning.},

  abstract = {Woody plants in fire-frequented ecosystems commonly resprout from underground organs after fires. Responses to variation in characteristics of fire regimes may be a function of plant physiological status or fire intensity. Although these hypotheses have been explored for trees in southeastern longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas, responses of other life forms and stages have not been studied. We examined effects of fire season and frequency, geography, habitat, and underground organ morphology on resprouting of shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each containing two habitats, upslope savannas and downslope seepages, in Louisiana and Florida. Each site, which contained quadrats located along transects within a 30 × 60 m plot, was burned either during the dormant or growing season and then reburned similarly two years later. Maximum fire temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub stems were censused in quadrats before and after fires. Shrubs collectively resprouted more following dormant than growing-season fires, regardless of habitat or geographic region. After repeated dormant-season fires, collective densities in seepages of both regions and densities of root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida seepages were greater than those initially and after repeated growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally unrelated to fire temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that resprouting of shrubs may be more dependent on their physiological status at the time of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse relationship between collective and root-crown-bearing shrub densities following repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in Florida seepages. Anthropogenic dormant-season fires over many decades may have resulted in increases in shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas, especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires, however, neither increased nor reduced densities of established shrubs. Long-term shifts in characteristics of fire regimes, even in fire-frequented habitats, may produce effects that are not reversible in the short term ({$<$}10 yr) by simply reintroducing prescribed fires that resemble those that occurred naturally during the growing season.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic influences have altered most fire regimes. Fire management programs often try to mimic natural fire regimes to maintain fuels and sustain native fire-dependent species. Lightning is the natural ignition source in Florida, substantiating the need for understanding lightning fire incidence. Sixteen years of lightning data (1986–2003, excluding 1987 and 2002 due to missing data) from the NASA Cloud to Ground Lightning Surveillance System and fire ignition records were used to quantify the relationship between lightning incidence and ignitions on Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. There were 230 lightning fires with an average of 14 ignitions per year, primarily in July, and only one winter ignition. Precipitation influenced the efficiency of lightning ignitions, particularly July precipitation. We found that negative polarity strikes caused the majority of ignitions. Pine flatwoods was ignited more frequently than expected given equal chance of ignition among landcover types. About half (51\%) of detected fires were instantaneous ignitions and the other 49\% were delayed an average of 2 days. This information is useful for paramaterizing fire regime models and for mimicking the natural fire regime through fire prescriptions on these properties and throughout the southeastern United States. These methods may be useful in fire-maintained systems globally.},

  abstract = {Wildfire can influence a variety of stream ecosystem properties. We studied stream temperatures in relation to wildfire in small streams in the Boise River Basin, located in central Idaho, USA. To examine the spatio-temporal aspects of temperature in relation to wildfire, we employed three approaches: a pre–post fire comparison of temperatures between two sites (one from a burned stream and one unburned) over 13 years, a short-term (3 year) pre–post fire comparison of a burned and unburned stream with spatially extensive data, and a short-term (1 year) comparative study of spatial variability in temperatures using a “space for time” substitutive design across 90 sites in nine streams (retrospective comparative study). The latter design included streams with a history of stand-replacing wildfire and streams with severe post-fire reorganization of channels due to debris flows and flooding. Results from these three studies indicated that summer maximum water temperatures can remain significantly elevated for at least a decade following wildfire, particularly in streams with severe channel reorganization. In the retrospective comparative study we investigated occurrence of native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and tailed frog larvae (Ascaphus montanus) in relation to maximum stream temperatures during summer. Both occurred in nearly every site sampled, but tailed frog larvae were found in much warmer water than previously reported in the field (26.6°C maximum summer temperature). Our results show that physical stream habitats can remain altered (for example, increased temperature) for many years following wildfire, but that native aquatic vertebrates can be resilient. In a management context, this suggests wildfire may be less of a threat to native species than human influences that alter the capacity of stream-living vertebrates to persist in the face of natural disturbance.},

  abstract     = {We collected soil-hydraulic property data from the literature for wildfire-affected soils, ash, and unburned soils. These data were used to calculate metrics and timescales of hydrologic response related to infiltration and surface runoff generation. Sorptivity (S) and wetting front potential (Ψf) were significantly different (lower) in burned soils compared with unburned soils, whereas field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) was not significantly different. The magnitude and duration of the influence of capillarity during infiltration was greatly reduced in burned soils, causing faster ponding times in response to rainfall. Ash had large values of S and Kfs but moderate values of Ψf, compared with unburned and burned soils, indicating ash has long ponding times in response to rainfall. The ratio of S2/Kfs was nearly constant ( 100 mm) for unburned soils but more variable in burned soils, suggesting that unburned soils have a balance between gravity and capillarity contributions to infiltration that may depend on soil organic matter, whereas in burned soils the gravity contribution to infiltration is greater. Changes in S and Kfs in burned soils act synergistically to reduce infiltration and accelerate and amplify surface runoff generation. Synthesis of these findings identifies three key areas for future research. First, short timescales of capillary influences on infiltration indicate the need for better measurements of infiltration at times less than 1 min to accurately characterize S in burned soils. Second, using parameter values, such as Ψf, from unburned areas could produce substantial errors in hydrologic modeling when used without adjustment for wildfire effects, causing parameter compensation and resulting underestimation of Kfs. Third, more thorough measurement campaigns that capture soil-structural changes, organic matter impacts, quantitative water repellency trends, and soil-water content along with soil-hydraulic properties could drive the development of better techniques for numerically simulating infiltration in burned areas.},

  abstract     = {Hydrologic recovery after wildfire is critical for restoring the ecosystem services of protecting of human lives and infrastructure from hazards and delivering water supply of sufficient quality and quantity. Recovery of soil-hydraulic properties, such as field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs), is a key factor for assessing the duration of watershed-scale flash flood and debris flow risks after wildfire. Despite the crucial role of Kfs in parameterizing numerical hydrologic models to predict the magnitude of postwildfire run-off and erosion, existing quantitative relations to predict Kfs recovery with time since wildfire are lacking. Here, we conduct meta-analyses of 5 datasets from the literature that measure or estimate Kfs with time since wildfire for longer than 3-year duration. The meta-analyses focus on fitting 2 quantitative relations (linear and non-linear logistic) to explain trends in Kfs temporal recovery. The 2 relations adequately described temporal recovery except for 1 site where macropore flow dominated infiltration and Kfs recovery. This work also suggests that Kfs can have low hydrologic resistance (large postfire changes), and moderate to high hydrologic stability (recovery time relative to disturbance recurrence interval) and resilience (recovery of hydrologic function and provision of ecosystem services). Future Kfs relations could more explicitly incorporate processes such as soil-water repellency, ground cover and soil structure regeneration, macropore recovery, and vegetation regrowth.},

  abstract     = {Among ecological communities, insects are important bioindicators of fire disturbance due to their sensitivity to environmental change and habitat requirements. In this study, we explored the relationship between insect abundance and distance from the ignition point of fires over a two-year period in an oak-dominated forest located in Southern Italy. Using 18 pitfall traps along three transects (running from the interior to the exterior of the burnt area), 2556 insect specimens belonging to eight orders and 26 families were collected. We used analysis of variance and developed a number of regression models to determine the spatial and temporal responses of insect abundance to fire. In addition, a comparison was made between terrestrial Coleoptera and Lepidoptera and the results were used to explain the effects of forest fire on different taxa. In terms of spatial variation, we observed a significant difference between abundance of Coleoptera in burnt (0–300m) and unburnt (300–600m) locations with the highest level of abundance in the forest at the edge of the burnt area. For Lepidoptera, differences were not as significant. In terms of temporal variation, we observed significant differences between the abundance of Coleoptera in the two study years, both in burnt and unburnt locations, with the highest level of abundance in the second year after fire. For Lepidoptera the temporal differences were also significant. The two insect orders showed a contrasting pattern in terms of mean abundance values: the abundance of Coleoptera increased during the survey period, while the abundance of Lepidoptera decreased. Fire disturbance influences the short-term response of insect abundance with positive or negative effects depending on the ecological traits and habits of taxa. Understanding these effects is crucial in highly-modified ecosystems, such as the Mediterranean forests.},

  abstract     = {Forests form the critical source water areas for downstream drinking water supplies in many parts of the world, including the Rocky Mountain regions of North America. Large scale natural disturbances from wildfire and severe insect infestation are more likely because of warming climate and can significantly impact water quality downstream of forested headwaters regions. To investigate potential implications of changing climate and wildfire on drinking water treatment, the 2003 Lost Creek Wildfire in Alberta, Canada was studied. Four years of comprehensive hydrology and water quality data from seven watersheds were evaluated and synthesized to assess the implications of wildfire and postfire intervention (salvage-logging) on downstream drinking water treatment. The 95th percentile turbidity and DOC remained low in streams draining unburned watersheds (5.1 NTU, 3.8 mg/L), even during periods of potential treatment challenge (e.g., stormflows, spring freshet); in contrast, they were elevated in streams draining burned (15.3 NTU, 4.6 mg/L) and salvage-logged (18.8 NTU, 9.9 mg/L) watersheds. Persistent increases in these parameters and observed increases in other contaminants such as nutrients, heavy metals, and chlorophyll-a in discharge from burned and salvage-logged watersheds present important economic and operational challenges for water treatment; most notably, a potential increased dependence on solids and DOC removal processes. Many traditional source water protection strategies would fail to adequately identify and evaluate many of the significant wildfire- and post-fire management-associated implications to drinking water “treatability”; accordingly, it is proposed that “source water supply and protection strategies” should be developed to consider a suppliers’ ability to provide adequate quantities of potable water to meet demand by addressing all aspects of drinking water “supply” (i.e., quantity, timing of availability, and quality) and their relationship to “treatability” in response to land disturbance.},

  abstract     = {Indonesia’s peatlands experience frequent and intense wildfires, producing hazardous smoke with consequences for human health, yet there is a lack of research into adverse effects on wildlife. We evaluated the effects of smoke on the activity and energy balance of Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) in a peat swamp forest at the Tuanan Research Station, Central Kalimantan. We collected behavioural data and urine samples from four adult flanged males before, during, and after wildfires between March 2015 and January 2016. During fires, particulate matter (PM10) concentrations were hazardous. Orangutans increased rest time during and after the smoke period, and decreased travel time and distance~and increased fat catabolism post-smoke. The increase in post-smoke ketones was not related to changes in caloric intake and was~likely due to an increase in energy expenditure, possibly related to immune response. Results show that wildfire smoke negatively affects orangutan condition, and sustained research is needed to assess the magnitude of the threat to the long-term viability of this Critically Endangered species.},

Portions of 6 burned areas (118 to 1,750 ha) were examined for signs of mortality of vertebrates. Direct effects of fire in desert habitats included animal mortality and loss of vegetation cover. A range of 0 to 7 tortoises was encountered during surveys, and live tortoises were found on all transects. In addition to desert tortoises, only small (Ͻ1 kg) mammals and reptiles (11 taxa) were found dead on the study areas. We hypothesize that indirect effects of fire on desert habitats might result in changes in the composition of diets and loss of vegetation cover, resulting in an increase in predation and loss of protection from temperature extremes. These changes in habitat also might cause changes in vertebrate communities in burned areas.},

Fragmented knowledge of the ecosystem services provided by novel ecosystems contributes to disagreement over these systems and how they should be managed. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of refereed articles to understand how novel ecosystems have changed ecosystem services and biodiversity. Despite anthropogenic drivers of change, we found that the literature on novel ecosystems is focused on ecological rather than social aspects of novel systems. Our review highlights the frequency that novel ecosystems enhance both ecosystem services and biodiversity. More than two-thirds of studies reported biodiversity equal to or above the reference state, while the portion of studies reporting increased cultural, provisioning, and regulating services was even greater. Still, we urge caution in interpreting these trends, as they exist in part due to degraded ecosystem baselines and inconsistent framing. Finally, the wide range of management recommendations we reviewed reflects both the diversity of novel ecosystems and substantial disagreement among researchers and managers about what novel ecosystems actually mean for society.},

Social anthropological, oral historical, archival and aerial photographic evidence shows how over long periods, peri-village forest islands have been created from savannas, productive rice swamps from inland valleys, and productive upland soil and vegetation conditions from unimproved herbaceous savanna. From 1893, colonial policy was based on reading the region’s environmental history backwards, assuming forest islands to be relics of a once-extensive dense humid forest cover which local agriculture and fire-setting had destroyed. Archival evidence shows how the deductions of botanists, agronomists and foresters, coupled with the assumptions of administrators and other visitors, mutually reinforced each other to create and sustain a vision of degradation so pervasive that it still underlies modern environmental policy. The paper examines how colonial and postcolonial policies conceived within this vision have interacted with local land use. Given varying administrative capabilities, it considers the extent to which changes in local practices have been conditioned by policy as opposed to other social, economic, political or ecological changes, and the extent to which environmental changes have fortuitously coincided with policy objectives.},

  abstract     = {Concern about desiccation – the effects of deforestation on climate 
and soils – was an early and pervasive theme in colonial science, present at the 
onset of West Africa's colonial era and with roots in previous centuries. 
As a set of scientists' ideas linked to soil and forest conservation policy, the 
impact of desiccationism was initially muted, struggling unsuccessfully in 
nascent administrations with more pressing political and administrative 
agendas. But by the end of the colonial period it can be argued that anxiety 
about desiccation had become a cornerstone of development practice and 
state penetration. This article uses a case study to consider the transformation 
of the status of the ‘science’ of desiccation within colonial development 
agendas, the responses this transformation eventually provoked and its 
enduring legacy.
            Our reflections here complement what has, in West African studies, 
become a general consensus about shifts in colonial forest policy. From the 
outset, many colonial administrations – both francophone and anglophone – 
were concerned both about the effects of forest loss on climate, hydrology 
and soils, and about the effects of ‘irrational and wasteful’ exploitation of 
forest as an economic resource. But early policy imperatives to establish 
reserves either failed to reach the implementation stage or could not be 
implemented due to the resistance they engendered, both from populations 
and indeed from agricultural or political administrations. A significant phase 
of reservation, at least in West Africa's humid forest and transition zones, 
began only in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and was pursued until the mid 
1950s by colonial states which increasingly gained the strength to impose 
unpopular policy despite resistance. From this perspective, and given that 
nationalist sentiments in pre-independence struggles were often pitted 
against repressive colonial forest services, it could be hypothesized that 
independence would bring regimes more responsive to local concerns and 
more likely to heed resistance. Yet such a view, focusing simply on state 
capacity in changing political contexts, overlooks qualitative changes in the 
configuration of science-policy relationships within the state, a 
reconfiguration that it is necessary to grasp if we are to understand how post-colonial forest policy was less a rupture than a continuation or, indeed, 
reinforcement.},

Robustness was equated with the strength, over a range of models, of the linear and monotonic (rank-order) relationship between the compositional dissimilarities and the corresponding Euclidean distances between sites measured in the ecological space. The range of models reflected different assumptions about species' response curve shape, sampling pattern of sites, noise level of the data, species' interactions, trends in total site abundance, and beta diversity of gradients. The Kulczynski, Bray-Curtis and Relativized Manhattan measures were found to have not only a robust monotonic relationship with ecological distance, but also a robust linear (proportional) relationship until ecological distances became large. Less robust measures included Chord distance, Kendall's coefficient, Chisquared distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance.},

In western North America, networks of the fire-scar records spanning centuries to millennia now include hundreds to thousands of trees sampled across hundreds to many thousands of hectares. Development of these local and regional fire-scar networks has created a new data type for ecologists interested in landscape and climate regulation of ecosystem processes – which, for example, may help to explain why forest fires are widespread during certain years but not others. These data also offer crucial reference information on fire as a dynamic landscape process for use in ecosystem management, especially when managing for forest structure and resilience to climate change.},

Vegetation patterns were influenced by fire history and aspect. Species richness was highest where the fire regime was moderate, and lowest in the fire-protected bush. The vegetation response at the Solar Village contrasted with another experiment, conducted at Munmalary in northern Australia, where fire was excluded from eucalypt forest and woodland. Very low numbers of facultative monsoon forest species seem favoured with fire protection at the Solar Village. Almost all common tree and shrub species moved into the mid canopy with fire protection, compared to Munmalary where most tree species did not leave the ground layer. The difference in the response of these two places is attributed to the interaction between site and fire influences and it is suggested that structural mutability of these forests increases on stressful sites, although the actual mechanics of the site/fire interactions remains unclear. There is no evidence to support an interactive model which predicts that relief from fire and favourable soil moisture conditions allows the accession of broadleaved shrubs into the mid storey.},

  abstract     = {The physical setting of 61 grassy balds on the Bunya Mountains in south-eastern Queensland was surveyed during 1995, and a further 73 balds were assessed from aerial photographs taken in 1951 and 1991. Balds were analysed to search for consistent environmental patterns that may account for their existence. There was little association between measured environmental variables (including altitude, surface rock cover, slope, landscape position, surrounding vegetation, bald area) and the occurrence of balds, although large balds have a weak association with steep slopes and relatively low rock cover. Grassland was on shallower soil than forest. Some, but not all balds were surrounded by rainforest. No consistent relationship was evident for all measured balds surrounded by eucalypt forest. About 26\% of the area of balds existing in 1951 had been invaded by forest by 1991. The extent of the invasion was generally higher for balds surrounded by eucalypt forest than balds surrounded by eucalypt and rainforest or rainforest only, but showed little relationship with other environmental variables. The invading tree species groups could not be associated with environmental variables. The lack of environmental correlation of bald location and size, and the rapid change in bald area is not supportive of hypotheses relating bald maintenance to intrinsic physical conditions. There is relatively poor species diversity of Eucalyptus on the Bunya Mountains and this narrow ecological range of species may be a limitation on the colonisation of the grasslands. Indirect evidence for the role of grazing and fire as agents of bald maintenance are discussed, and it is concluded, that fire, and not grazing, is likely to be a major influence.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTThe immediate effects of a low soil burn severity wildfire on hydrological parameters and soil erosion were evaluated in a Pinus pinaster Ait. stand by means of rainfall simulations (140 mm h?1). The unburned forest soil was repellent at the mineral surface (100\%) at the same degree as the burned ones. The diameter of soil aggregates and the particle size distribution did not differ between burned and unburned soils. The mean storage capacity of the unburned soil organic layer was 0.94?4.85 mm m?2 from the litter to the duff layers. The corresponding values for the capillary capacity were from 7.11 mm to 6.72 mm. In the burned plots, these figures were 1.42 mm m?2 for the mean storage capacity and 5.9 mm for the capillary capacity. The burned plots recorded significantly lower infiltration rates (29 mm h?1) and higher runoff (111 mm) and sediment yields (20.8~g m? 2) compared to the unburned controls. The characteristics of the soil organic layer significantly affected the infiltration rate and runoff volume. In a subsequent experiment, the remaining organic layer was completely removed and a new rainfall simulation was carried out. In unburned soils decreases in the infiltration rate and increases in the runoff volume were recorded with no significant changes in the sediment yields. In the burned plots, removal of the duff layer only led to a significant increase in soil erosion (20.8?51.4~g m?2). The above information could be used to help plan post-fire stabilization actions.},

  abstract = {Background. Reptiles are sensitive to habitat disturbance induced by wildfires but species frequently show opposing responses. Functional causes of such variability have been scarcely explored. In the northernmost limit of the Mediterranean bioregion, lizard species of Mediterranean affinity (Psammodromus algirus and Podarcis guadarramae) increase in abundance in burnt areas whereas Atlantic species (Lacerta schreiberi and Podarcis bocagei) decrease. Timon lepidus, the largest Mediterranean lizard in the region, shows mixed responses depending on the locality and fire history. We tested whether such interspecific differences are of a functional nature, namely, if ecophysiological traits may determine lizard response to fire. Based on the variation in habitat structure between burnt and unburnt sites, we hypothesise that Mediterranean species, which increase density in open habitats promoted by frequent fire regimes, should be more thermophile and suffer lower water losses than Atlantic species. Methods. We submitted 6–10 adult males of the five species to standard experiments for assessing preferred body temperatures (Tp) and evaporativewater loss rates (EWL), and examined the variation among species and along time by means of repeated-measures AN(C)OVAs. Results. Results only partially supported our initial expectations, since the medium-sized P. algirus clearly attained higher Tp and lower EWL. The two small wall lizards (P. bocagei and P. guadarramae) displayed low Tp and high EWL while the two large green lizards (T. lepidus and L. schreiberi) displayed intermediate values for both parameters. Discussion. The predicted differences according to the biogeographic affinities within each pair were not fully confirmed. We conclude that ecophysiology may help to understand functional reptile responses to fire but other biological traits are also to be considered.},

  abstract     = {A strategy is presented for analysing marine biological survey data and relating the biotic patterns to environmental data. To avoid circular argument, biotic and environmental data are kept separate. The strategy is illustrated by a worked example using data on the distribution of 182 nematode species in 107 samples in the River Exe estuary. Nineteen stations are grouped Into 4 main clusters using complementary classification and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) ordination techniques. These are both based on root-root transformed abundance data with the Bray-Curtis measure of similarity. Indicator species characterising each group are extracted using information statistics. Inverse analyses give clusters of CO-occurnngspecies which are strongly related to the station groups. Relationships of station groups to environmental variables are revealed by superimposing data for one variable at a time on the MDS plot, showing that some station groups differ in sediment granulometry and others in salinity, for example. Some of the other factors plotted show n o difference between station groups. Similarly, physiognomic charactcrlstics of the species are superimposed on the MDS plots of the inverse analysis of species groups, revealing differences in setal length and trophic status between the species groups. Finally, the 4 major station groups and species groups are related to one another in terms of morphological adaptation to the habitat.},

  abstract     = {We explore the basis of understanding wildland fire behaviour with the intention of stimulating curiosity and promoting fundamental investigations of fire spread problems that persist even in the presence of tremendous modelling advances. Internationally, many fire models have been developed based on a variety of assumptions and expressions for the fundamental heat transfer and combustion processes. The diversity of these assumptions raises the question as to whether the absence of a sound and coherent fire spread theory is partly responsible. We explore the thesis that, without a common understanding of what processes occur and how they occur, model reliability cannot be confirmed. A theory is defined as a collection of logically connected hypotheses that provide a coherent explanation of some aspect of reality. Models implement theory for a particular purpose, including hypotheses of phenomena and practical uses, such as prediction. We emphasise the need for theory and demonstrate the difference between theory and modelling. Increasingly sophisticated fire management requires modelling capabilities well beyond the fundamental basis of current models. These capabilities can only be met with fundamental fire behaviour research. Furthermore, possibilities as well as limitations for modelling may not be known or knowable without first having the theory.},

  abstract     = {Fire-maintained ecosystems and associated species are becoming increasingly rare in the southern Appalachian Mountains because of fire suppression policies implemented in the early 20th century. Restoration of these communities through prescribed fire has been hindered by a lack of information on historical fire regimes. To characterize past fire regimes, we collected and absolutely dated the tree rings on cross sections from 242 fire-scarred trees at three different sites in the southern Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. Our objectives were to (1) characterize the historical frequency of fire in southern Appalachian mixed pine–oak forests, (2) assess the impact of interannual climatic variability on the historical occurrence of fire, and (3) determine whether changes in human culture and land use altered the frequency of fire. Results demonstrate that fires burned frequently at all three sites for at least two centuries prior to the implementation of fire suppression and prevention in the early to mid 20th century. Composite mean fire return intervals were 2–4 yr, and point mean fire return intervals were 9–13 yr. Area-wide fires that burned across multiple stands occurred at 6–13-yr intervals. The majority of fires were recorded during the dormant season. Fire occurrence exhibited little relationship with reconstructed annual drought conditions. Also, fire activity did not change markedly during the transition from Native American to EuroAmerican settlement or during the period of industrial logging at the start of the 20th century. Fire activity declined significantly, however, during the fire suppression period, with a nearly complete absence of fire during recent decades. The characterization of past fire regimes should provide managers with specific targets for restoration of fire-associated communities in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The fire chronologies reported here are among the longest tree-ring reconstructions of fire history compiled for the eastern United States and support the hypothesis that frequent burning has played a long and important role in the development of forests in the southern Appalachian Mountains.},

  abstract     = {Pacific Northwest salmonids are adapted to natural disturbance regimes that create dynamic habitat patterns over space and through time. However, human land use, particularly long-term fire suppression, has altered the intensity and frequency of wildfire in forested upland and riparian areas. To examine the potential impacts of wildfire on aquatic systems, we developed stream-reach-scale models of freshwater habitat for three life stages (adult, egg/fry, and juvenile) of spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Wenatchee River subbasin, Washington. We used variables representing pre- and post-fire habitat conditions and employed novel techniques to capture changes in in-stream fine sediment, wood, and water temperature. Watershed-scale comparisons of high-quality habitat for each life stage of spring Chinook salmon habitat suggested that there are smaller quantities of high-quality juvenile overwinter habitat as compared to habitat for other life stages. We found that wildfire has the potential to increase quality of adult and overwintering juvenile habitat through increased delivery of wood, while decreasing the quality of egg and fry habitat due to the introduction of fine sediments. Model results showed the largest effect of fire on habitat quality associated with the juvenile life stage, resulting in increases in high-quality habitat in all watersheds. Due to the limited availability of pre-fire high-quality juvenile habitat, and increased habitat quality for this life stage post-fire, occurrence of characteristic wildfires would likely create a positive effect on spring Chinook salmon habitat in the Wenatchee River subbasin. We also compared pre- and post-fire model results of freshwater habitat for each life stage, and for the geometric mean of habitat quality across all life stages, using current compared to the historic distribution of spring Chinook salmon. We found that spring Chinook salmon are currently distributed in stream channels in which in-stream habitat for most life stages has a consistently positive response to fire. This compares to the historic distribution of spring Chinook, in which in-stream habitat exhibited a variable response to fire, including decreases in habitat quality overall or for specific life stages. This suggests that as the distribution of spring Chinook has decreased, they now occupy those areas with the most positive potential response to fire. Our work shows the potentially positive link between wildfire and aquatic habitat that supports forest managers in setting broader goals for fire management, perhaps leading to less fire suppression in some situations.},

  abstract     = {Management in fire-prone ecosystems relies widely upon application of prescribed fire and/or fire surrogate (e.g., forest thinning) treatments to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function. Recently, published literature examining wildlife response to fire and fire management has increased rapidly. However, none of this literature has been synthesized quantitatively, precluding assessment of consistent patterns of wildlife response among treatment types. Using meta-analysis, we examined the scientific literature on vertebrate demographic responses to burn severity (low/moderate, high), fire surrogates (forest thinning), and fire and fire surrogate combined treatments in the most extensively studied fire-prone, forested biome (forests of the United States). Effect sizes (magnitude of response) and their 95\% confidence limits (response consistency) were estimated for each species-by-treatment combination with two or more observations. We found 41 studies of 119 bird and 17 small-mammal species that examined short-term responses (≤4 years) to thinning, low/moderate- and high-severity fire, and thinning plus prescribed fire; data on other taxa and at longer time scales were too sparse to permit quantitative assessment. At the stand scale ({$<$}50 ha), thinning and low/moderate-severity fire demonstrated similar response patterns in these forests. Combined thinning plus prescribed fire produced a higher percentage of positive responses. High-severity fire provoked stronger responses, with a majority of species possessing higher or lower effect sizes relative to fires of lower severity. In the short term and at fine spatial scales, fire surrogate forest-thinning treatments appear to effectively mimic low/moderate-severity fire, whereas low/moderate-severity fire is not a substitute for high-severity fire. The varied response of taxa to each of the four conditions considered makes it clear that the full range of fire-based disturbances (or their surrogates) is necessary to maintain a full complement of vertebrate species, including fire-sensitive taxa. This is especially true for high-severity fire, where positive responses from many avian taxa suggest that this disturbance (either as wildfire or prescribed fire) should be included in management plans where it is consistent with historic fire regimes and where maintenance of regional vertebrate biodiversity is a goal.},

  abstract     = {Resource selection by animals influences individual fitness, the abundance of local populations, and the distribution of species. Further, the degree to which individuals select particular resources can be altered by numerous factors including competition, predation, and both natural- and human-induced environmental change. Understanding the influence of such factors on the way animals use resources can guide species conservation and management in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of a prescribed fire on small-scale (microhabitat) resource selection, abundance, body condition, and movement pathways of a native Australian rodent, the bush rat ( Rattus fuscipes ). Using a before-after, control-impact design, we gathered data from 60 individuals fitted with spool and line tracking devices. In unburnt forest, selection of resources by bush rats was positively related to rushes, logs and complex habitat, and negatively related to ferns and litter. Fire caused selection for spreading grass, rushes, and complex habitat to increase relative to an unburnt control location. At the burnt location after the fire, rats selected patches of unburnt vegetation, and no rats were caught at a trapping site where most of the understory had been burnt. The fire also reduced bush rat abundance and body condition and caused movement pathways to become more convoluted. After the fire, some individuals moved through burnt areas but the majority of movements occurred within unburnt patches. The effects of fire on bush rat resource selection, movement, body condition, and abundance were likely driven by several linked factors including limited access to shelter and food due to the loss of understory vegetation and heightened levels of perceived predation risk. Our findings suggest the influence of prescribed fire on small mammals will depend on the resulting mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches and how well this corresponds to the resource requirements of particular species.},

To do this plant removal and propagule addition experiments were conducted at nine old-field sites to examine the effects of living plant neighbours and litter on seedling establishment and growth of target species in relation to community biomass. 2 For two target species, Andropogon gerardi and Schizachyrium scoparium, living plant neighbours suppressed establishment from seed at most sites, and suppressed the growth of transplants at all sites. 3 Plant litter strongly inhibited the seedling establishment of both Andropogon and Schizachyrium at sites of high community biomass and litter accumulation, but had little impact on the growth rate of transplants at any of the sites. 4 The total suppressive effect of the plant community on seedling establishment and transplant growth of both Andropogon and Schizachyrium increased in magnitude in a non-linear fashion with community biomass. These effects increased in magnitude more rapidly across sites of low to medium biomass than sites of medium to high biomass. 5 The results suggest that these native grasses may be restricted to low productivity habitats within this landscape because of strong competitive interference with establishment by the existing vegetation in the most productive sites.},

Simulations accurately represent structural changes associated with increased density and cover of the fire-sensitive Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei, Buckbolz) and provide substantial evidence for multiple steady states and ecological thresholds. Without fire, Ashe juniper increases and herbaceous biomass decreases at exponential rates until a dense-canopy woodland is formed after approximately 75 years. Maintenance of a grass-dominated community for 1.50 years requires cool-season fires at a return interval of less than 25 years. When initial cool-season fires are delayed or return intervals are increased, herbaceous biomass (fuel) decreases below a threshold and changes from grassland to woodland become irreversible. With warm-season fires, longer return intervals maintain grass dominance, and under extreme warm-season conditions even nearly closed-canopy stands can be opened with catastrophic wildfires.},

Any discussion of an interaction between fire and grazing is usually based on a statistical approach that ignores the spatial and temporal interactions on complex landscapes. We propose a new focus on the ecological interaction of fire and grazing in which each disturbance is spatially and temporally dependent on the other and results in a landscape where disturbance is best described as a shifting mosaic (a landscape with patches that vary with time since disturbance) that is critical to ecological structure and function of many ecosystems. We call this spatiotemporal interaction pyric herbivory (literal interpretation means grazing driven by fire). Pyric herbivory is the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and grazing, where positive and negative feedbacks promote a shifting pattern of disturbance across the landscape. We present data we collected from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in the southern Great Plains of North America that demonstrates that the interaction between free-roaming bison (Bison bison) and random fires promotes heterogeneity and provides the foundation for biological diversity and ecosystem function of North American and African grasslands. This study is different from other studies of fire and grazing because the fires we examined were random and grazing animals were free to roam and select from burned and unburned patches. For ecosystems across the globe with a long history of fire and grazing, pyric herbivory with any grazing herbivore is likely more effective at restoring evolutionary disturbance patterns than a focus on restoring any large vertebrate while ignoring the interaction with fire and other disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Forest restoration guided by historical reference conditions of fire regime, forest structure, and composition has been increasingly and successfully applied in fire-adapted forests of western North America. But because climate change is expected to alter vegetation distributions and foster severe disturbances, does it make sense to restore the ecological role of wildland fire through management burning and related activities such as tree thinning? I suggest that some site- and date-specific historical conditions may be less relevant, but reference conditions in the broad sense are still useful. Reference conditions encompass not only the recent past but also evolutionary history, reflecting the role of fire as a selective force over millennia. Taking a long-term functional view of historical reference conditions as the result of evolutionary processes can provide insights into past forest adaptations and migrations under various climates. As future climates change, historical reference data from lower, southerly, and drier sites may be useful in places that are higher, northerly, and currently wetter. Almost all models suggest that the future will have substantial increases in wildfire occurrence, but prior to recent human-caused fire exclusion, fire-adapted pine forests of western North America were among the most frequently burned in the world. Restoration of patterns of burning and fuels/forest structure that reasonably emulate historical conditions prior to fire exclusion is consistent with reducing the susceptibility of these ecosystems to catastrophic loss. Priorities may include fire and thinning treatments of upper elevation ecotones to facilitate forest migration, whereas vulnerable low-elevation forests may merit less management investment.},

  abstract = {As wildfire activity increases in many regions of the world, it is imperative that we understand how key components of fire-prone ecosystems respond to spatial variation in fire characteristics. Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee community, with more individuals and more species captured during late summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations—flowering plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees—also increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse wild bee communities. This finding has particularly important implications for biodiversity in fire-prone areas given the expected expansion of wildfires in the coming decades.},

  abstract     = {Context. Prescribed (or controlled) burning is frequently advocated as a means of reducing fuel loads in peri-urban forests to minimise the risk of high-intensity wildfires. An important consideration in prescribed burns is the impact on native wildlife. Aims. An opportunity arose to follow the movements of radio-collared peri-urban swamp wallabies during a prescribed burn and after an unexpected wildfire in the same location a short time later. Movement data was used to assess the relative impacts of the prescribed burn and wildfire on mortality, emigration and habitat use; the behavioural responses and methods of avoidance used by swamp wallabies in response to an oncoming fire front; and the management implications for wildlife that inhabit fire-prone habitats in proximity to human settlement where wildfire mitigation is necessary. Methods. Here we report on the movements of radio-collared swamp wallabies, Wallabia bicolor, before, during and after a prescribed fire and after a wildfire on the same site 6 months later. Key results. No radio-collared swamp wallabies were killed during the prescribed burn and only one wallaby was observed to emigrate from the area post-fire. This contrasted to the wildfire where one wallaby died during or just after the fire and another perished in the post-fire environment a few months later. The wildfire also increased emigration post-fire. Conclusions. We demonstrate that wallabies can avoid fire fronts and that this avoidance behaviour may be more successful during cooler fires. The prescribed burn provided a suitable habitat for wallabies but did not result in a shift in habitat preference. Implications. Mitigation of the impact of prescribed burns on swamp wallabies may be achieved by allowing sufficient time for habitat complexity to re-establish between burns.},

The form of this decrease for samples without sampling errors has been analyzed and found to be a complement of a non-standardized error function for percentage similarity, and similar functions for coefficient of community and Euclidean distance. For samples affected by sampling error, altered and somewhat flattened curves result. These relationships are important in many ordination techniques. In particular, it is demonstrated that Bray-Curtis ordination can be improved by application of the inverse function transforms with moderate beta diversity (up to 5 half-changes). Such transforms produce similarity measures which are linear with respect to separation along the gradient, up to the point beyond which samples have practically no species in common and similarity measures of any sort are consequently meaningless.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Apex predators can suppress smaller bodied ?mesopredators.? In doing so, they can provide refuge to species preyed upon by mesopredators, which is particularly important in regions where mesopredators are invasive. While most studies of mesopredator suppression focus on the response of mesopredators to human control of apex predators, other factors?including natural and anthropogenic disturbance?also drive the occurrence of apex predators and, in doing so, might shape spatial patterns of mesopredator suppression. We examined the role of fire in shaping the occurrence of an apex predator and, by extension, mesopredators and small mammals in a fire-prone region of semiarid Australia. We measured the activity of an apex predator (the dingo Canis dingo); an invasive mesopredator it is known to suppress (the red fox Vulpes vulpes); and two species of native small mammal (Mitchell's hopping mouse Notomys mitchelli; silky mouse Pseudomys apodemoides) that are potential prey, across 21 fire mosaics (each 12.56~km2). We used piecewise structural equation modelling and scenario analysis to explore the interactions between fire, predators and prey. We found that dingoes were affected by fire history at the landscape scale, showing a preference for recently burned areas. While foxes were not directly affected by fire history, a negative association between dingoes and foxes meant that fire had an indirect impact on foxes, mediated through dingoes. Despite the suppression of foxes by dingoes, we did not observe a trophic cascade as small mammals were not negatively associated with foxes or positively associated with dingoes. Synthesis and applications. Disturbance regimes have the capacity to shape patterns of mesopredator suppression when they alter the distributions of apex predators. Environmental change that promotes native predators can therefore help suppress mesopredators?a common conservation objective in regions with invasive mesopredators. The indirect consequences of disturbance regimes should be considered when managing disturbance (e.g. fire) for biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Knowledge of how disturbances such as fire shape habitat structure and composition, and affect animal interactions, is fundamental to ecology and ecosystem management. Predators also exert strong effects on ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their ubiquity,~ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor, hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators worldwide. We found 160 studies spanning 1978?2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes (Hedge's g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas, or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations, taxonomic families, and study designs, but most were located in North America and Oceania (59\% and 24\%, respectively), and largely focussed on felids (24\%) and canids (25\%). Half (50\%) of the studies reported responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life history traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers (Coluber constrictor) negatively, with variances overlapping zero only slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific management of predator-fire relationships is required.},

  abstract     = {We examined the fire‐induced changes in groundwater recharge rate. This aspect is particularly important in the case of large forested areas growing over a coastal aquifer affected by saltwater intrusion. In the Ravenna coastal area (Italy), pine forests grow on coastal dune belts, overlying a sandy unconfined aquifer, which is strongly affected by marine ingression. Three groundwater profiles across the forest and perpendicular to the coastline were monitored for groundwater level, physical, and chemical parameters. The aims were to define groundwater quality, recharge rate, freshwater volume, and highlight change, which occurred after a forest fire with reference to pre‐fire conditions. Analytical solutions based on Darcy Law and the Dupuit Equation were applied to calculate unconfined flow and compare recharge rates among the profiles. The estimated recharge rates increased in the partially and completely burnt areas (219 and 511 mm year−1, respectively) compared with the pristine pine forest area (73 mm year−1). Although pre‐fire conditions were similar in all monitored profiles, a post‐fire decrease in salinity was observed across the burnt forest, along with an increase in infiltration and freshwater lens thickness. This was attributed to decrease canopy interception and evapotranspiration caused by vegetation absence after the fire. This research provided an example of positive forest fire feedback on the quantity and quality of fresh groundwater resources in a lowland coastal aquifer affected by saltwater intrusion, with limited availability of freshwater resources. The fire provided an opportunity to evaluate a new forest management approach and consider the restoration and promotion of native dune herbaceous vegetation.},

The problem is complex and contingent, requiring continual attention to the changing circumstances of stakeholders, landscapes, and ecosystems; it occurs at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Minimizing adverse outcomes involves controlling fires and fire regimes, increasing the resistance of assets to fires, locating or relocating assets away from the path of fires, and, as a probability of adverse impacts often remains, assisting recovery in the short term while promoting the adaptation of societies in the long term. There are short- and long-term aspects to each aspect of minimization. Controlling fires and fire regimes may involve fire suppression and fuel treatments such as prescribed burning or non-fire treatments but also addresses issues associated with unwanted fire starts like arson. Increasing the resistance of assets can mean addressing the design and construction materials of a house or the use of personal protective equipment. Locating or relocating assets can mean leaving an area about to be impacted by fire or choosing a suitable place to live; it can also mean the planning of land use. Assisting recovery and promoting adaptation can involve insuring assets and sharing responsibility for preparedness for an event. There is no single, simple, solution. Perverse outcomes can occur. The number of minimizing techniques used, and the breadth and depth of their application, depends on the geographic mix of asset types. Premises for policy consideration are presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The aim of this study was to assess the effects on combustion characteristics,and their consequenceson nutrient losses, of (1) the change in load and packing ratio of the fuel bed, and (2) the change in fuel moisture content.Eighty-oneexperimentalburns were camedout, on a test bench in the laboratory; the fuel was composed of needlesand twigs of Pinus pinaster. Twolevelsof fuel load and packing ratio (8t ha-' needles, packing ratio of 0.040; and 16t ha-' twigs and needles, packing ratio of 0.066) werecornparedatconstant moisturecontent(6\%);and four levels of moisture content (6\%,12\%,24\%and 30\%dry weight)werecomparedatconstantfuelload (8tha-'needles). At constant moisture content, an increase in the load and packing ratio of the fuel bed led to an increase in the height of flamesand in the maximum temperature25 cm above the fuel bed, in the duration of the rise in temperatures within the fuel, and in the fireline intensity. Conversely, the rate of fire spread decreased. At constant fuel load, an increase in the moisture content of the fuel led to adecreasein therateoffirespread,in theflameheightand the maximum temperature 25 cm above the fuel bed, and in the fireline intensity. In contrast, the maximum temperatures reached within the fuel, when the flaming front was continuous, did not significantly change with varying fuel loads or fuel moisture contents. The percentage fuel consumptionwas always high, more than 80\%,but it significantly decreased with increasing fuel load and packing ratio and with increasing moisture content. Total lossesofN, S,and K significantlydecreasedwith increasing fuel load and packing ratio, with increasing moisture content and with decreasing percentage fuel consumption. Losses in P only significantly decreased with increasing fuel load and packing ratio. Losses in Mg and Ca were not significantly affected by fuel load, moisture content or percentage consumption. An attempt was made to separate volatile from particulate losses, based on the assumption that all the losses of Ca were in particulate form. Whereas losses in particulate form remained relatively constant, losses of nutrients in volatile form seem to have been related to the percentage fuel consumption. Even if these experimental bums were of low intensity (40 to 56 kW m-I),their impact, in terms of lethal temperatures and nutrient losses, was not negligible, particularly for N and P. The increasing fireline intensity with increasing fuel load was not accompanied by an enhancement in the proportion of nutrient losses. In the same way, the strong decrease in fireline intensity with increasing fuel moisture content led only to a slight decrease in some nutrient losses. It was through their effecton the percentage fuel consumption that fuel load or moisture content modified the nutrient losses, particularly volatile losses.},

  abstract     = {Field  studies on the effects of heating soil are rare. Studies in which the temperature  was varied and measured are even rarer. To cover this lack of knowledge, we conducted  some experimental fires in which the fuel was controlled to obtain different fire  intensities. Induced temperatures were measured by k-type thermocouples placed at  various soil depths. These induced temperatures were highly variable at the soil  surface, whereas below 2.5-cm depth, the temperature rise was negligible. Modifications  of various soil physico-chemical parameters caused by fire were related to increasing  temperatures at the soil surface. The passage of fire promoted the aggregation of  clay particles into sand-sized particles, which become even more resistant to the  disrupting action of water. The soil pH decreased at temperatures up to 395°C,  followed by a clear increase at higher temperatures; however, both the cation exchange  capacity and the organic matter content decreased continuously with increasing soil  temperature. Total nitrogen content remained surprisingly constant as the soil surface  temperature increased, whereas ammonium nitrogen peaked at 184°C. The organic  phosphorus decreased continuously, and the available fractions increased.
        These  results are in agreement with the results of our previous research on the effects  of the artificial heating on soil properties and confirm that the processes occurring  in soil are related to the temperature reached during the fire. The ashes, at least  immediately after fire, do not affect these processes.},

We surveyed mixed conifer forest with 995–1178 trees ha−1 (stems {$>$} 10 cm diameter at breast height), and nearby pine–oak woodland having 175–230 trees ha−1, 51 days after a severe burn, to contrast the spatial extent and properties of thermally altered soil at sites with different tree densities. Water-repellent soils were more extensive in forest than woodland. Deposits of white ash, composed largely of calicite, covered at most ∼25\% of the land surface, in places where large fuel items (e.g. logs, branches, exfoliated oak bark) had thoroughly combusted. At least 1690 kg ha−1 of CaCO3 in ash was deposited over the forest, and at least 700 kg ha−1 was added to the woodland. Combustion of logs and large branches also reddened the underlying yellow-brown soil as deep as 60 mm (average 8 mm), and over ∼1–12\% of the land surface. The reddened soils have magnetic susceptibilities that are three to seven times greater than surrounding unreddened soils within the burn, indicating thermal production of maghemite. Such fire-altered conditions persist over spatial and temporal scales that influence soil genesis in Mediterranean-type climate regions.},

In the course of establishing these large farms, the system of land tenure has been radically changed, since written evidence of registration is necessary to raise a loan and to be produced in case of dispute. These changes, combined with the more direct effects of social differentiation, have resulted in the burning of rice and the destruction of machinery.},

  abstract     = {Frequent fire is necessary for maintaining sub-tropical and tropical grassland ecosystems, without which they may transform to forest. In the biodiversity-rich Drakensberg mountains of southern Africa, a challenge for conservation is to emulate the natural fire regime driven mainly by lightning ignition which existed before human influence commenced 25,000 BP. Here, a naturally variable fire regime was replaced with a rigid, frequent fire regime about a century ago in order to maintain a vigorous grass sward for sustained water delivery. However, its impact on plant diversity is not known. We tested impacts of frequent and infrequent fire regimes established by 1957 on grassland composition and diversity at the long-term Cathedral Peak research catchments. Historic sampling of grass composition in 1980 and 1986 was repeated in 2014, at which time forbs were sampled in order to examine a potential influence of fire on diversity. Grass composition was remarkably resistant to different fire regimes over the study period, with changes in the relative abundance of individual species limited to ≤6\%. Only two decades after implementing return intervals of one to eight years was a proportion of composition variance explained by the fire regime. Forbs contributed 78\% of total species richness and were influenced by the effects of the fire regime on grassland structure (e.g. making space available for recruitment). Forb richness corroborated with the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis and was greater in areas with intermediate fire regimes. However, forb turnover was explained in part by both frequent and infrequent fire regimes. Therefore, although richness may be greater under intermediate fire regimes, to maintain unique forb assemblages or turnover, a variable fire regime, believed to reflect the historic lightning-driven fire regime, is demonstrated to be important for maintaining grassland diversity.},

  abstract = {Globally, fire maintains many mesic habitats in an open canopy state by killing woody plants while reducing the size of those able to resprout. Where fire is frequent, tree saplings are often suppressed by a “fire trap” of repeated topkill (death of aerial biomoass) and resprouting, preventing them from reaching adult size. The ability to tolerate repeated topkill is an essential life-history trait that allows a sapling to persist until it experiences a long fire-free interval, during which it can escape the fire trap. We hypothesized that persistence in the fire trap results from a curvilinear relationship between pre-burn size and resprout size, which causes a plant to approach an equilibrial size in which post-fire biomass recovery is equal to fire-induced biomass loss. We also predicted that the equilibrial stem size is positively related to resource availability. To test these hypotheses, we collected data on pre-burn and resprout size of five woody plant species at wetland ecotones in longleaf pine savanna subjected to frequent burning. As expected, all species exhibited similar curvilinear relationships between pre-burn size and resprout size. The calculated equilibrial sizes were strong predictors of mean plant size across species and growing conditions, supporting the persistence equilibrium model. An alternative approach using matrix models yielded similar results. Resprouting was less vigorous in dry sites than at wet sites, resulting in smaller equilibrial stem sizes in drier sites; extrapolating these results provides an explanation for the absence of these species in xeric uplands. This new framework offers a straightforward approach to guide data collection for experimental, comparative, and modeling studies of plant persistence and community dynamics in frequently burned habitats.},

  abstract     = {Over 35 days in January–February 2003, wildfires burnt across much of the subalpine/alpine landscape of south-eastern Australia, including about 70\% of the land above 1500 m in the Snowy Mountains. At the time of the fire, studies of two subalpine faunal assemblages were being undertaken. The opportunity to resurvey the assemblages was taken in order to examine the immediate impact of fire in an environment where it is uncommon but predicted to occur increasingly with global warming. A study area in the Whites River Valley, where the number of bird species was counted monthly from 1996 to 2003, and weekly in late winter–spring from 2000 to 2003, was burnt in one fire. As well as the expected decrease in the number of individual birds, the fire resulted in an immediate decrease in the number of bird species, unlike in previously studied montane forest, with only the regularly wintering species plus the olive whistler and the ground-feeding flame robin remaining. During the post-winter avian immigration, few regular spring migrants appeared on burnt sites despite their nearby presence on the unburnt side of the valley. Five of six small mammal trapping grids were burnt. As with fires at lower altitudes, there was an immediate reduction in mammal numbers on burnt grids following the fire, but in addition, one species, Mastacomys fuscus, declined further in the ensuing 2 months both on burnt and unburnt sites. Numbers of Antechinus swainsonii and Rattus fuscipes stabilized until autumn/winter when there was a further decline due to the unavailability of subnivean space to allow winter foraging, allied with a concentration of fox predation on areas still carrying populations of small mammals.},

  abstract     = {Given the increase in wildfire intensity and frequency worldwide, prescribed burning is becoming a more common and widespread practice. Prescribed burning is a fire management tool used to reduce fuel loads for wildfire suppression purposes and occurs on an annual basis in many parts of the world. Smoke from prescribed burning can have a substantial impact on air quality and the environment. Prescribed burning is a significant source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5µm) and these particulates are found to be consistently elevated during smoke events. Due to their fine nature PM2.5 are particularly harmful to human health. Here we discuss the impact of prescribed burning on air quality particularly focussing on PM2.5. We have summarised available case studies from Australia including a recent study we conducted in regional Victoria, Australia during the prescribed burning season in 2013. The studies reported very high short-term (hourly) concentrations of PM2.5 during prescribed burning. Given the increase in PM2.5 concentrations during smoke events, there is a need to understand the influence of prescribed burning smoke exposure on human health. This is important especially since adverse health impacts have been observed during wildfire events when PM2.5 concentrations were similar to those observed during prescribed burning events. Robust research is required to quantify and determine health impacts from prescribed burning smoke exposure and derive evidence based interventions for managing the risk.Implications:?Given the increase in PM2.5 concentrations during PB smoke events and its impact on the local air quality, the need to understand the influence of PB smoke exposure on human health is important. This knowledge will be important to inform policy and practice of the integrated, consistent, and adaptive approach to the appropriate planning and implementation of public health strategies during PB events. This will also have important implications for land management and public health organizations in developing evidence based objectives to minimize the risk of PB smoke exposure.},

  abstract = {The timing, extent, and severity of forest wildfires have increased in many parts of the world in recent decades. These wildfires can have substantial and devastating impacts on water supply, ecohydrological systems, and sociohydrosystems. Existing frameworks to assess the magnitude and spatial extent of these effects generally focus on local processes or services and are not readily transferable to other regions. However, there is a growing need for regional, continental, and global scale indices to assess the potential effect of wildfires on freshwater availability and water supply resilience. Such indices must consider both the individual and compound effects of wildfires. In so doing, this will enable comprehensive insights on the water security paradigm and the value of hydrological services in fire-affected areas around the globe. Plain Language Summary The number of large forest fires and the length of the wildfire season have both increased globally in the past few decades. Wildfire trends are expected to continue due to increasing occurrence of drought and denser forests associated with historical forest management and fire suppression. This development has raised concerns for water supplies because most water used for irrigation, industry, hydropower, recreation, and community drinking water comes from rivers draining watersheds that are prone to wildfires. As such, it is critical to improve our understanding of the capacity of watersheds and downstream communities to absorb or mitigate fire impacts. In this commentary, we emphasize the need for new continental and global scale indices to assess the full range of wildfire hazards to water supply and society. This will ultimately contribute to sustainable policies and land management plans for safeguarding water supplies and community health.},

Insects preferring the unburned site were mostly entomophagous flies such as pipunculids, chamaemyiids, and tachinids. Insects more common at the burned site were mosquitoes and phytophagous species of lygaeid bugs, leafhoppers, and moths. Seasonal trends in relative abundance of major families of flying insects are reported. Ground survivors included gryllacridids, carabids, tenebrionids, and ants.

We used prescribed fire to experimentally alter the short-term fire history of patches within a firefrequented old-growth pine savanna over a 3 y period. We then quantified fungal abundance before and after the final fire using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) assays and Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR). Short-term fire history largely did not affect total fungal abundance nor pre-to post-fire abundance shifts. While producing similar conclusions, PLFA and ddPCR data were not correlated. In addition to piloting a new method to quantify soil fungal abundance, our findings indicate that, within fire-frequented pine savannas, recurrent fires do not consistently decrease total fungal abundance, and abundance changes are not contingent upon short-term fire history. This suggests that many fungi in fire-dependent ecosystems are fire-tolerant.},

  abstract     = {The 2007 Angora Fire served as a stark reminder of the need for fuel reduction treatments in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California–Nevada, USA. Concerns exist, however, that the corresponding removal of forest floor fuels could increase erosion rates, negatively affecting the clarity of Lake Tahoe. To quantify trade-offs between fuel reduction and erosion, we conducted field-based snowmelt runoff simulation experiments at 16 sites within the Lake Tahoe Basin that had received mechanical mastication or prescribed fire treatments. Erodibility was measured to determine if thresholds of litter, duff, and woody fuel cover could be established that are sufficient for trapping sediment and increasing infiltration, without contributing to fire hazard. Field snow-melt simulations revealed that as little as 25\% of the ground surface covered with masticated fuels over duff was sufficient to mitigate erosion. The post-prescribed fire environment characterized by heterogeneous patches of exposed bare mineral soil interspersed with unburned patches mitigated erosion by increasing infiltration. Considerable increases in sediment yield were observed in plots with {$>$}35\% of ground area burned; the highest total sediment yields (values) occurred in plots where between 66\% and 100\% of the soil surface burned. Our field results suggest that erosion and wildfire severity can be simultaneously mitigated through the use of masticated fuel reduction treatments or prescribed fire treatments that leave sufficient organic matter to trap sediment but have sufficiently low fuel loading and/or enough fuel discontinuity or patchiness to limit fire spread.},

  abstract     = {Soil microorganisms have numerous functional roles in forest ecosystems, including: serving as sources and sinks of key nutrients and catalysts of nutrient transformations; acting as engineers and maintainers of soil structure; and forming mutualistic relationships with roots that improve plant fitness. Although both prescribed and wildland fires are common in temperate forests of North America, few studies have addressed the long-term influence of such disturbances on the soil microflora in these ecosystems. Fire alters the soil microbial community structure in the short-term primarily through heat-induced microbial mortality. Over the long-term, fire may modify soil communities by altering plant community composition via plant-induced changes in the soil environment. In this review, we summarize and synthesize the various studies that have assessed the effects of fire on forest soil microorganisms, emphasizing the mechanisms by which fire impacts these vital ecosystem engineers. The examples used in this paper are derived primarily from studies of ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Inland West of the USA; these forests have some of the shortest historical fire-return intervals of any forest type, and thus the evolutionary role of fire in shaping these forests is likely the strongest. We argue that the short-term effects of fire on soil microflora and the processes they catalyze are transient, and suggest that more research be devoted to linking long-term plant community responses with those of the mutually dependent soil microflora.},

  abstract     = {Aim Climate warming and increased wildfire activity are hypothesized to catalyse biogeographical shifts, reducing the resilience of fire-prone forests world-wide. Two key mechanisms underpinning hypotheses are: (1) reduced seed availability in large stand-replacing burn patches, and (2) reduced seedling establishment/survival after post-fire drought. We tested for regional evidence consistent with these mechanisms in an extensive fire-prone forest biome by assessing post-fire tree seedling establishment, a key indicator of forest resilience. Location Subalpine forests, US Rocky Mountains. Methods We analysed post-fire tree seedling establishment from 184 field plots where stand-replacing forest fires were followed by varying post-fire climate conditions. Generalized linear mixed models tested how establishment rates varied with post-fire drought severity and distance to seed source (among other relevant factors) for tree species with contrasting post-fire regeneration adaptations. Results Total post-fire tree seedling establishment (all species combined) declined sharply with greater post-fire drought severity and with greater distance to seed sources (i.e. the interior of burn patches). Effects varied among key species groups. For conifers that dominate present-day subalpine forests (Picea engelmannii, Abies lasiocarpa), post-fire seedling establishment declined sharply with both factors. One exception was serotinous Pinus contorta, which did not vary with either factor. For montane species expected to move upslope under future climate change (Larix occidentalis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Populus tremuloides) and upper treeline species (Pinus albicaulis), establishment was unrelated to either factor. Greater post-fire tree seedling establishment on cooler/wetter aspects suggested local topographic refugia during post-fire droughts. Main conclusions If future drought and wildfire patterns manifest as expected, post-fire tree seedling establishment of species that currently characterize subalpine forests could be substantially reduced. Compensatory increases from lower montane and upper treeline species may partially offset these reductions, but our data suggest important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity.},

  abstract     = {Ecosystem engineers directly or indirectly affect the availability of resources through changing the physical state of biotic and/or abiotic materials. Fossorial ecosystem engineers have been hypothesized as affecting fire behaviour through altering litter accumulation and breakdown, however, little evidence of this has been shown to date. Fire is one of the major ecological processes affecting biodiversity globally. Australia has seen the extinction of 29 of 315 terrestrial mammal species in the last 200 years and several of these species were ecosystem engineers whose fossorial actions may increase the rate of leaf litter breakdown. Thus, their extinction may have altered the rate of litter accumulation and therefore fire ignition potential and rate of spread. We tested whether a reduction in leaf litter was associated with sites where mammalian ecosystem engineers had been reintroduced using a pair-wise, cross-fence comparison at sites spanning the Australian continent. At Scotia (New South Wales), Karakamia (Western Australia) and Yookamurra (South Australia) sanctuaries, leaf litter mass (−24\%) and percentage cover of leaf litter (−3\%) were significantly lower where reintroduced ecosystem engineers occurred compared to where they were absent, and fire behaviour modelling illustrated this has substantial impacts on flame height and rate of spread. This result has major implications for fire behaviour and management globally wherever ecosystem engineers are now absent as the reduced leaf litter volumes where they occur will lead to decreased flame height and rate of fire spread. This illustrates the need to restore the full suite of biodiversity globally.},

  abstract     = {From 1962 through 1998, 20 prescribed burns were applied in a natural stand of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) to determine the effects of various fire regimes on the forest plant community. The original longleaf seedlings regenerated from the 1955 seed crop and were growing in a grass-dominated cover when the study began. By 1999, prescribed burning in March and May resulted in a significantly greater stocking of longleaf pine (203 trees/ac) than on the unburned and July burned treatments (72 trees/ac) (α = 0.05). Fire arrested the growth of natural loblolly pine (P. taeda L.) and hardwoods, but loblolly pines and hardwoods of at least 4 in. dbh added 70 ft2/ac of basal area on the unburned plots. Thus, total woody basal area was significantly greater on the unburned (117 ft2/ac) and May burned (132 ft2/ac) treatments than on the July burned treatment (66 ft2/ac); basal area was intermediate on the March burned treatment (97 ft2/ac). Pine volume was 4,315, 2,870, 2,652, and 1,970 ft3 inside-bark/ac on the May burned, March burned, unburned, and July burned treatments, respectively, but these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.06). There was only 11 lb/ac of herbaceous plants on the unburned plots. Herbaceous plants averaged 993 lb/ac on the three burned treatments, with pinehill bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium var. divergens [Hack] Gould) being the most common herbaceous plant. We believe the chief influence of burning in this natural longleaf pine forest was not on pine yield but how fires influenced overall stand structure and species composition. South. J. Appl.

  abstract     = {Open biomass burning from wildfires and the prescribed burning of forests and farmland is a frequent occurrence in South-East Queensland (SEQ), Australia. This work reports on data collected from 10 to 30 September 2011, which covers the days before (10–14 September), during (15–20 September) and after (21–30 September) a period of biomass burning in SEQ. The aim of this project was to comprehensively quantify the impact of the biomass burning on air quality in Brisbane, the capital city of Queensland. A multi-parameter field measurement campaign was conducted and ambient air quality data from 13 monitoring stations across SEQ were analysed. During the burning period, the average concentrations of all measured pollutants increased (from 20\% to 430\%) compared to the non-burning period (both before and after burning), except for total xylenes. The average concentration of O3, NO2, SO2, benzene, formaldehyde, PM10, PM2.5 and visibility-reducing particles reached their highest levels for the year, which were up to 10 times higher than annual average levels, while PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations exceeded the WHO 24-hour guidelines and O3 concentration exceeded the WHO maximum 8-hour average threshold during the burning period. Overall spatial variations showed that all measured pollutants, with the exception of O3, were closer to spatial homogeneity during the burning compared to the nonburning period. In addition to the above, elevated concentrations of three biomass burning organic tracers (levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan), together with the amount of non-refractory organic particles (PM1) and the average value of f60 (attributed to levoglucosan), reinforce that elevated pollutant concentration levels were due to emissions from open biomass burning events, 70\% of which were prescribed burning events. This study, which is the first and most comprehensive of its kind in Australia, provides quantitative evidence of the significant impact of open biomass burning events, especially prescribed burning, on urban air quality. The current results provide a solid platform for more detailed health and modelling investigations in the future.},

  abstract     = {Fire became a defining feature of the Earth’s processes as soon as land plants evolved 420 million years ago and has played a major role in shaping the composition and physiognomy of many ecosystems ever since. However, there remains a general lack of appreciation of the place of fire in the origin, evolution, ecology and conservation of the Earth’s biodiversity. We review the literature on the presence of fire throughout the Earth’s history following the evolution of land plants and examine the evidence for the origin and evolution of adaptive functional traits, biomes and major plant groups in relation to fire. We show that: (1) fire activities have fluctuated throughout geological time due to variations in climate, and more importantly in atmospheric oxygen, as these affected fuel levels and flammability; (2) fire promoted the early evolution and spread of major terrestrial plant groups; (3) fire has shaped the floristics, structure and function of major global biomes; and (4) fire has initiated and maintained the evolution of a wide array of fire-adapted functional traits since the evolution of land plants. We conclude that fire has been a fundamental agent of natural selection on terrestrial plants throughout the history of life on the Earth’s land surface. We suggest that a paradigm shift is required to reassess ecological and evolutionary theories that exclude a role for fire, and also there is a need to review fire-suppression policies on ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation in global fire-prone regions.},

  abstract     = {Many terrestrial ecosystems are fire prone, such that their composition and structure are largely due to their fire regime. Regions subject to regular fire have exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism, and fire has been proposed as a major driver of their diversity, within the context of climate, resource availability and environmental heterogeneity. However, current fire-management practices rarely take into account the ecological and evolutionary roles of fire in maintaining biodiversity. Here, we focus on the mechanisms that enable fire to act as a major ecological and evolutionary force that promotes and maintains biodiversity over numerous spatiotemporal scales. From an ecological perspective, the vegetation, topography and local weather conditions during a fire generate a landscape with spatial and temporal variation in fire-related patches (pyrodiversity), and these produce the biotic and environmental heterogeneity that drives biodiversity across local and regional scales. There have been few empirical tests of the proposition that ‘pyrodiversity begets biodiversity’ but we show that biodiversity should peak at moderately high levels of pyrodiversity. Overall species richness is greatest immediately after fire and declines monotonically over time, with postfire successional pathways dictated by animal habitat preferences and varying lifespans among resident plants. Theory and data support the ‘intermediate disturbance hypothesis’ when mean patch species diversity is correlated with mean fire intervals. Postfire persistence, recruitment and immigration allow species with different life histories to coexist. From an evolutionary perspective, fire drives population turnover and diversification by promoting a wide range of adaptive responses to particular fire regimes. Among 39 comparisons, the number of species in 26 fire-prone lineages is much higher than that in their non-fire-prone sister lineages. Fire and its byproducts may have direct mutagenic effects, producing novel genotypes that can lead to trait innovation and even speciation. A paradigm shift aimed at restoring biodiversity-maintaining fire regimes across broad landscapes is required among the fire research and management communities. This will require ecologists and other professionals to spread the burgeoning fire-science knowledge beyond scientific publications to the broader public, politicians and media.},

  abstract     = {Objectives Anecdotal and formal evidence indicate that primates take advantage of burned landscapes. However, little work has been done to quantify the costs and benefits of this behavior. Using systematic behavioral observations from a population of South African vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus), we evaluate differences in food availability and energetics before and after controlled burns altered vegetation near their home range. We aim to determine whether burned habitats offer improved foraging opportunities. Methods We collected feeding data from foraging individuals and analyzed common plant foods for their energetic content. We then used the feeding and energetic data to calculate postencounter profitabilities and encounter rates for food types. Using negative binomial and mixed linear regression models we compared data from burned and unburned habitats. Results Our results show significantly improved encounter rates in burned landscapes for two prey items, invertebrates and grasses. However, postencounter profitabilities in burned areas were not significantly different than those achieved in unburned areas. Conclusions Results suggest that improved encounters alone can motivate changes in foraging behavior. These foraging benefits enable the exploitation of burned savanna habitats, likely driving postburn range expansions observed among populations of vervet monkeys. Thus quantified, these results may serve as a foundation for hypotheses regarding the evolution of fire-use in our own lineage. Am J Phys Anthropol 159:432–441, 2016. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The amount of carbon stored in savannas represents a significant uncertainty in global carbon budgets, primarily because fire causes actual biomass to differ from potential biomass. We analyzed the structural response of woody plants to long-term experimental burning in savannas. The experiment uses a randomized block design to examine fire exclusion and the season and frequency of burn in 192 7-ha experimental plots located in four different savanna ecosystems. Although previous studies would lead us to expect tree density to respond to the fire regime, our results, obtained from four different savanna ecosystems, suggest that the density of woody individuals was unresponsive to fire. The relative dominance of small trees was, however, highly responsive to fire regime. The observed shift in the structure of tree populations has potentially large impacts on the carbon balance. However, the response of tree biomass to fire of the different savannas studied were different, making it difficult to generalize about the extent to which fire can be used to manipulate carbon sequestration in savannas. This study provides evidence that savannas are demographically resilient to fire, but structurally responsive.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Foraging in burned areas has been suggested to represent the earliest stage in the use and control of fire by early hominins. Recently burned areas offer immediate foraging benefits including increased search efficiency for high-ranked food items and decreased hunting opportunities for ambush predators. As such, they provide a triple-bonus (reduced risk from ambush, ease of terrestrial travel and higher foraging returns) for some primates. However, previous studies have not yet accounted for other types of predators e.g., coursing (endurance predators that can pursue prey over long distances) which were sympatric with hominins and may also have exploited these environments. Behavioral ecology studies on the use of burned landscapes by extant carnivores demonstrate that while some ambush predators avoid recently burned areas, coursing predators do take advantage of their immediate hunting opportunities. Research examining habitat selection by animals under the simultaneous threat of multiple predator species with different modes of hunting, and the diversity of Plio-Pleistocene carnivore guild is suggestive of two possible evolutionary scenarios in which hominins could either have selected or avoided burned areas (3?2 mya), based on whether ambush or coursing predators were perceived as presenting the greatest risk.},

Novel ecosystems (also termed ‘emerging ecosystems’) result when species occur in combinations and relative abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome. Key characteristics are novelty, in the form of new species combinations and the potential for changes in ecosystem functioning, and human agency, in that these ecosystems are the result of deliberate or inadvertent human action. As more of the Earth becomes transformed by human actions, novel ecosystems increase in importance, but are relatively little studied. Either the degradation or invasion of native or ‘wild’ ecosystems or the abandonment of intensively managed systems can result in the formation of these novel systems. Important considerations are whether these new systems are persistent and what values they may have. It is likely that it may be very difficult or costly to return such systems to their previous state, and hence consideration needs to be given to developing appropriate management goals and approaches.},

  abstract = {Due to frequent fire, low nutrient availability, and prolonged drought, tropical savanna is a stressful environment for the survival and growth of woody plant seedlings. To understand why forest species do not succeed in this environment while savanna species are able to persist, the effects of fire and woody cover on seedlings of these two functional groups were investigated in the Brazilian Cerrado. Seedlings were established in experimental plots under three densities of woody cover, in sites protected from fire and sites to be subjected to fire. There was a clear difference in the ability of savanna and forest species to survive fire. None of the three forest species were able to survive fire during the first two years of life, whereas eight of the nine savanna species were able to resprout following fire. The small seed size of the ninth savanna species, Miconia albicans, predisposed its seedlings to be sensitive to fire, because there was a strong positive correlation between seed size and survivorship. Savanna species were less dependent on woody cover than were forest species, which exhibited higher growth and survival under tree canopies than in open grassland. The low rates of establishment and survival of forest trees in savanna, combined with high sensitivity to fire, appear sufficient to prevent the expansion of forest into savanna under current fire regimes in the Cerrado.},

In a replicated experiment, we studied the impact of fire and vegetation cover on survival and growth of two subshrubs (Periandra mediterranea and Protium ovatum), two shrubs (Miconia albicans and Rourea induta) and three trees (Myrsine guianensis, Piptocarpha rotundifolia and Roupala montana) of the Brazilian cerrado savannas. Burning increased complete mortality (i.e. death of the individual) of five of the seven species, but primarily among individuals with stem diameters ¡4mm. Stem mortality (i.e. topkill) was much more prevalent, primarily affecting individuals with stem diameter ¡32mm, though all species experienced some topkill in even the largest size classes. Fires of higher intensity (flame length ¿2m) caused greater mortality and topkill than fires of lower intensity (flame length ¡2m). Pre-burn vegetation density had little effect on survival or resprout size, but did affect subsequent growth rates. Four species had greater growth rates in open sites, whereas only one species had greater growth rates in dense sites. For the three tree species and one shrub, resprouting individuals did not reach the minimum reproductive size within 1 year of burning, while the other shrub and the two subshrubs were able to reach reproductive size during this time, indicating that growth form largely determines the population response to frequent burning.},

  abstract     = {ConspectusWildfires are a natural part of most forest ecosystems, but due to changing climatic and environmental conditions, they have become larger, more severe, and potentially more damaging. Forested watersheds vulnerable to wildfire serve as drinking water supplies for many urban and rural communities. The highly variable nature of wildfire behavior combined with spatially complex patterns in vegetation, landscape, and hydrologic factors create uncertainty surrounding the postfire effects on water supplies. Wildfires often cause dramatic changes in forest vegetation structure and soil conditions, and alter the watershed processes that control streamflow, soil erosion, nutrient export, and downstream water chemistry. The authors’ work centers on field and laboratory studies to advance knowledge of postfire changes in soil and water chemical composition that influence drinking water treatment. High intensity postfire rainstorms typically increase runoff that erodes ash and soil from burned landscapes and dramatically elevates turbidity, nutrient, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in surface waters, which can cause short-term challenges for water providers. There is also growing evidence that water quality impacts can persist after high severity fires due to slow vegetative recovery, and nitrogen and DOC have remained elevated for 15 years following high severity fire. Low-moderate temperatures during wildfire may also influence water quality. Research by the authors showed that the solubility of organic matter, and C and N released from soils increased following soil heating at temperatures ≤ 350 °C. Further, the water extracted organic matter from soils heated at 225–350 °C included higher proportions of condensed aromatic structures, such as black carbon and black nitrogen. Short-term postfire water quality degradation following high intensity rainstorms can force water treatment plants to shut down or can significantly challenge treatment process performance. Extreme turbidity and high DOC in poststorm water, coupled with compositional organic matter changes, reduced the coagulation efficiency of postfire water supplies. Field and lab-based studies documented the formation of small, aromatic soluble compounds during wildfire that contribute to inefficient DOC removal from postfire stormwater. Due to increased postfire DOC concentrations, and poor treatability of poststorm runoff, toxic disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation increased during water treatment. Exceedance of drinking water standards for the carbonaceous DBPs, trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, may present a critical management concern for water providers following wildfires. Further, postfire formation of nitrogen compounds and increased nitrogenous DBP precursors for haloacetonitriles and chloropicrin were discovered. N-DBPs pose a public health concern due to their toxicity, and water providers should be aware of potential increases in N-DBP formation following fire. Evidence from the authors’ studies demonstrates that even partially burned watersheds and wildfires burning at moderate temperature can have significant, lasting effects on C and N exports, source water quality, drinking water treatability, and DBP formation. Both short- and long-term postfire water quality impacts can create challenges for drinking water providers as they confront variability in supply and treatability. Communities, forest managers, and potable water providers will need to adapt to more frequent, destructive wildfires and anticipate greater variability in water quality.},

  abstract     = {Disturbance has long been a central issue in amphibian conservation, often regarding negative effects of logging or other forest management activities, but some amphibians seem to prefer disturbed habitats. After documenting increased use of recently burned forests by boreal toads (Bufo boreas), we hypothesized that burned habitats provided improved thermal opportunities in terrestrial habitats. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a radio telemetry study of habitat use (reported previously) and by using physical models that simulated the temperature of adult toads. We deployed 108 physical models in and adjacent to a 1-year old burn using a fully-replicated design with three burn severities (unburned, partial, high severity) and four microhabitats (open surface, under vegetation, under log, in burrow). Model temperatures were compared to a range of preferred temperatures in published studies. We found 70\% more observations within the preferred temperature range of B. boreas in forests burned with high severity than in unburned areas. Burned forest was warmer than unburned forest across all microhabitats, but the largest relative difference was in burrows, which averaged 3°C warmer in high-severity burn areas and remained warmer though the night. More than twice as many observations were within the preferred temperature range in high-severity burrows than in unburned burrows. Areas burned with high severity were still warmer than unburned forest 3 years after the fire. Habitat use of toads during the concurrent radio telemetry study matched that predicted by the physical models. These results suggest there are fitness-linked benefits to toads using burned habitats, such as increased growth, fertility, and possibly disease resistance. However, increased soil temperatures that result from wildfire may be detrimental to other amphibian species that prefer cooler temperatures and stable environments. More broadly, our data illustrate the use of physical models to measure and interpret changes that amphibians may experience from disturbance, and highlight the need for research linking vital rates such as growth and survival to disturbance.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of drought and wildfire. Aquatic and moisture-sensitive species, such as amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to these modified disturbance regimes because large wildfires often occur during extended droughts and thus may compound environmental threats. However, understanding of the effects of wildfires on amphibians in forests with long fire-return intervals is limited. Numerous stand-replacing wildfires have occurred since 1988 in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3 amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between 1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate occupancy during prefire (0–4 years) and different postfire recovery periods. For the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), occupancy was not affected for 6 years after wildfire. But 7–21 years after wildfire, occupancy for both species decreased ≥25\% in areas where {$>$}50\% of the forest within 500 m of wetlands burned. In contrast, occupancy of the boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas) tripled in the 3 years after low-elevation forests burned. This increase in occupancy was followed by a gradual decline. Our results show that accounting for magnitude of change and time lags is critical to understanding population dynamics of amphibians after large disturbances. Our results also inform understanding of the potential threat of increases in wildfire frequency or severity to amphibians in the region.

  abstract = {The impacts of climate driven change on ecosystem processes and biodiversity are pervasive and still not fully understood. Biodiversity loss, range shifts, and phenological mismatches are all issues associated with a changing climate that are having significant impacts on individuals and ecosystems alike. Investigating and identifying effective management strategies that can conserve vulnerable species should be the focus of current and future climate change research. We investigated thermal properties of habitat for an imperiled grouse (Greater Prairie-chicken; Tympanuchus cupido) in tallgrass prairie characterized by heterogeneous fire and grazing (the fire-grazing interaction). We examined operative temperature at varying scales relevant to grouse and used historic and forecasted climate data to estimate thermal stress during nesting activities. We found that heterogeneous grasslands have high thermal variability with operative temperature ranging as much as 23°C across the landscape. Grouse exhibited strong selection for cooler thermal environments as nest sites were as much as 8°C cooler than the surrounding landscape, and fine-scale differences in thermal environments were nearly 4°C cooler than sites within 2 m of nests. Additionally, forecasted climate scenarios indicate grouse will experience 2?4 times the number of hours above thermal stress thresholds, emphasizing the need for informed conservation management. Overall, these data provide evidence that variation in grassland structure resulting from the fire-grazing interaction may be important in moderating thermal environments and highlights the complex and interactive effects of restored ecological processes on ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {It is well understood that landscape processes can affect habitat selection patterns, movements, and species persistence. These selection patterns may be altered or even eliminated as a result of changes in disturbance regimes and a concomitant management focus on uniform, moderate disturbance across landscapes. To assess how restored landscape heterogeneity influences habitat selection patterns, we examined 21 years (1991, 1993–2012) of Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) lek location data in tallgrass prairie with restored fire and grazing processes. Our study took place at The Nature Conservancy’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve located at the southern extent of Flint Hills in northeastern Oklahoma. We specifically addressed stability of lek locations in the context of the fire-grazing interaction, and the environmental factors influencing lek locations. We found that lek locations were dynamic in a landscape with interacting fire and grazing. While previous conservation efforts have treated leks as stable with high site fidelity in static landscapes, a majority of lek locations in our study (i.e., 65\%) moved by nearly one kilometer on an annual basis in this dynamic setting. Lek sites were in elevated areas with low tree cover and low road density. Additionally, lek site selection was influenced by an interaction of fire and patch edge, indicating that in recently burned patches, leks were located near patch edges. These results suggest that dynamic and interactive processes such as fire and grazing that restore heterogeneity to grasslands do influence habitat selection patterns in prairie grouse, a phenomenon that is likely to apply throughout the Greater Prairie-Chicken’s distribution when dynamic processes are restored. As conservation moves toward restoring dynamic historic disturbance patterns, it will be important that siting and planning of anthropogenic structures (e.g., wind energy, oil and gas) and management plans not view lek locations as static points, but rather as sites that shift around the landscape in response to shifting vegetation structure. Acknowledging shifting lek locations in these landscapes will help ensure conservation efforts are successful by targeting the appropriate areas for protection and management.},

  abstract     = {Recent large wildfires in western states have fueled increasing concerns of resource managers and the public about the effects of fire, including risks to fish, particularly endangered species. However, there are few empirical studies on the response of fish to fire and none that include anadromous species. The Tower Fire was one of four large fires in the upper John Day River basin in Oregon in 1996. Much of the area burned at moderate to high severity, consistent with the pattern of increasing fire severity and size projected for the region. Intense spring storms in 1997 and 1998 triggered large floods, landslides, and debris torrents that affected streams within and downstream of the fire. We investigated the effects of the fire and ensuing floods on fish distribution and abundance in three streams immediately after the fire through 2003. Immediately after the fire, no fish were found in moderate- and high-intensity burn areas. Fish began to repopulate defaunated reaches the year after the fire, and within 4 years distribution of juvenile steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) and resident rainbow trout was similar to that before the fire. Juvenile spring Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha also began to use lower reaches of one of the streams after the flood, which had eliminated a culvert near the mouth of the stream suspected to be a barrier. Densities in most burned reaches and in unburned reaches downstream of the fire have rebounded to levels similar to or greater than densities in reference streams outside of the fire. An isolated introduced population of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis also recovered. Thus, despite the size and severity of the fire, postfire hydrologic events, and human-induced changes to watersheds, fish populations were highly resilient.},

  abstract     = {Smoldering is the dominant combustion process in peat fire, releasing a large amount of carbon and smoke into the atmosphere. The spread of smoldering in peatland is a multi-dimensional process, which is slow, low-temperature, persistent, and difficult to detect. In this work, we investigate the upward spread of peat fire from the underground to the surface after forced ignition which is a relevant configuration but rarely studied. In the experiment, ignition is not possible if the igniter is deeper than 15 cm below the free surface, regardless of moisture content or density. Once ignited, the 1st-stage upward fire spread is initiated towards the free surface (opposed smoldering) with a peak temperature of 300 °C, leaving behind a char structure that does not collapse. Then, a 2nd-stage downward spread (forward smoldering) is activated with a peak temperature of 600 °C and regression of free surface. The upward spread is faster than the downward spread. The rates of both upward and downward spread decrease as the peat density or depth is increased. These experimental observations are successfully captured by a 1D computational model of heat and mass transfer with 5-step kinetics. Modelling results further suggest that (1) the oxygen diffusion controls the entire upward-to-downward spread of peat fire, (2) the oxidation of peat sustains the 1st-stage upward spread, and (3) the oxidation of char sustains the 2nd-stage downward spread. This is the first study investigating the upward spread of peat fire, which helps understand the persistence of peat fire and guide the fire prevention and suppression strategies.},

  abstract     = {Fire-induced soil hydrophobicity is presumed to be a primary cause of the observed post-fire increases in runoff and erosion from forested watersheds in the Colorado Front Range, but the presence and persistence of hydrophobic conditions has not been rigorously evaluated. Hence the goals of this study were to: (1) assessnatural and fire-induced soil hydrophobicity in the Colorado Front Range, and (2) determine the effect of burn severity, soil texture, vegetation type, soil moisture, and time since burning on soil hydrophobicity . Five wild and prescribed fires ranging in age from 0 to 22 months were studied. Each fire had four study sites in ponderosa pine forests that had been burned at high, moderate, or low severity, and three sites were in unburned areas. Additional sites were established in lodgepole pine stands and an area with unusually coarse-textured soils. At each site the soil hydrophobicity was assessedin two pits using the water drop penetration time (WDPT) and the critical surface tension (CST). Measurements were made at the mineral soil surface and depths of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 cm. In sites burned at moderate or high severity the soils were often strongly hydrophobic at 0, 3, and 6 cm. Unburned sites or 5ites burned at low severity were typically hydrophobic only at the surface. Although soil hydrophobicity generally strengthened with increasing burn severity, statistically significant differences in soil hydrophobicity were difficult to detect because of the high variability within and between sites. Hydrophobicity also increased with increasing percent sand and was not present when soil moistures exceeded 12-25\%. There were no significant differences in soil hydrophobicity between ponderosa and lodgepole pine stands, regardless of burn severity.},

  abstract     = {Wildfires are a natural component in many terrestrial ecosystems and often play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, particularly in the fire-prone regions of Australia. A prime example of plants that are able to persist in these regions is the genus Banksia. Most Banksia species that occur in fire-prone regions produce woody seed pods (follicles), which open during or soon after fire to release seeds into the post-fire environment. For population persistence, many Banksia species depend on recruitment from these canopy-stored seeds. Therefore, it is critical that their seeds are protected from heat and rapid oxidation during fire. Here, we show how different species of Banksia protect their seeds inside follicles while simultaneously opening up when experiencing fire. The ability of the follicles to protect seeds from heat is demonstrated by intense 180 second experimental burns, in which the maximum temperatures near the seeds ranged from \textasciitilde 75 °C for B. serrata to \textasciitilde 90 °C for B. prionotes and \textasciitilde 95 °C for B. candolleana, contrasting with the mean surface temperature of \textasciitilde 450 °C. Many seeds of native Australian plants, including those of Banksia, are able to survive these temperatures. Structural analysis of individual follicles from these three Banksia species demonstrates that all of them rely on a multicomponent system, consisting of two valves, a porous separator and a thin layer of air surrounding the seeds. The particular geometric arrangement of these components determines the rate of heat transfer more than the tissue properties alone, revealing that a strong embedment into the central rachis can compensate for thin follicle valves. Furthermore, we highlight the role of the separator as an important thermal insulator. Our study suggests that the genus Banksia employs a variety of combinations in terms of follicle size, valve thickness, composition and geometric arrangement to effectively protect canopy-stored seeds during fire.},

  abstract     = {Abstract: During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A comppilation of these data with bird-count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land-management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand-replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire-dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned-forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element—standing, fire-killed trees–needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.

  abstract     = {Many scientists and forest land managers concur that past fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvesting practices have created unnatural and unhealthy conditions in the dry, ponderosa pine forests of the western United States. Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely “unnatural” or “unhealthy.” Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe fire provides an important ecological backdrop for fire specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe fire may be much broader than commonly appreciated.},

It also examines the climate impacts of most anthropogenic heat and moisture fluxes (AHFs and AMFs). Transient 20 year simulations indicate BB may cause a net global warming of \textasciitilde 0.4 K because CAE I (\textasciitilde 32\% of BB warming), CAE II, semidirect effects, AHFs (\textasciitilde 7\%), AMFs, and aerosol absorption outweigh direct aerosol cooling and indirect effects, contrary to previous BB studies that did not treat CAEs, AHFs, AMFs, or brown carbon. Some BB warming can be understood in terms of the anticorrelation between instantaneous direct radiative forcing (DRF) changes and surface temperature changes in clouds containing absorbing aerosols. BB may cause \textasciitilde 250,000 (73,000–435,000) premature mortalities/yr, with {$>$}90\% from particles. AHFs from all sources and AMFs + AHFs from power plants and electricity use each may cause a statistically significant +0.03 K global warming. Solar plus thermal-IR DRFs were +0.033 (+0.027) W/m2 for all AHFs globally without (with) evaporating cooling water, +0.009 W/m2 for AMFs globally, +0.52 W/m2 (94.3\% solar) for all-source BC outside of clouds plus interstitially between cloud drops at the cloud relative humidity, and +0.06 W/m2 (99.7\% solar) for BC inclusions in cloud hydrometeor particles. Modeled post-1850 biomass, biofuel, and fossil fuel burning, AHFs, AMFs, and urban surfaces accounted for most observed global warming.},

  abstract     = {In many countries, prescribed or planned burning is increasingly used as a management strategy to reduce the risk and negative effects of wildfires. As a by-product of this practice, ash, charcoal and partially charred material (referred to here as pyrogenic carbon, PC) is created. The amount and type of PC produced and fate of this form of carbon is uncertain. PC is often assumed to be resistant to chemical and microbial degradation and therefore potentially persistent in soils for hundreds or thousands of years. As a result, PC has been proposed as a sink for carbon and promoted for its storage potential in soil. We hypothesised that the differing components of PC would interact differently with soil processes and have varying potential for carbon storage. We analysed the chemical composition of PC produced by prescribed fire in a eucalypt forest and measured its effect on soil respiration. A laboratory incubation experiment showed that when PC of differing size fractions was added to soil, only the smallest size fraction (,1 mm; ash) increased rates of soil respiration, whereas larger fractions (charcoal) had little effect. The carbon contained in charcoal was resistant to microbial degradation and had little effect on microbial processes such as respiration. In general, fires of greater intensity will produce greater proportional amounts of smaller size particles and will likely result in faster rates of respiration than fires of lesser intensity. Therefore, lower intensity fires may ultimately have a greater capacity for soil carbon sequestration than those of higher intensity.},

  abstract     = {Litter layers have a negative effect on seedling recruitment in many ecosystems. Successional fen grasslands are characterized by the built-up of litter layers which might be a key-factor influencing species composition and diversity during succession. Seed size is thought to be an important feature for the regeneration niche of species. Large seed size has been shown to be of advantage for germination and establishment under shaded conditions and beneath litter layers and thus for late-successional species. We investigated the effects of litter (control, litter layer of 3 cm and 8 cm) on seedling recruitment in 35 grassland species varying in seed size and successional status and on the abiotic conditions temperature, light quantity and light quality. Furthermore, we analyzed the species' light requirement for germination and its relation to seed size, successional status and establishment beneath litter. Light quantity was significantly lower beneath litter (reduction of 78\% and 91\% beneath 3 cm and 8 cm litter, respectively). The R/FR-ratio decreased from 1.2 without litter to 0.8 and 0.6 in presence of 3 cm and 8 cm litter. Seedling recruitment of 33 species was hampered by a litter layer. Establishment in presence of litter was positively related to seed size (r = 0.62, p {$<$} 0.001 and r = 0.46, p {$<$} 0.01 for 3 cm and 8 cm litter, respectively). In addition, establishment of early-successional species was hampered by litter to a significantly greater extent than recruitment of late-successional species independent of seed mass (ANCOVA: F = 7.6, p {$<$} 0.01). We found a positive relation between seed mass and the proportion of germination in darkness (r = 0.57, p {$<$} 0.001) indicating that small-seeded species had a higher light requirement for germination. We also found positive relationships between the proportion of germination in darkness and establishment in the 3 cm and the 8 cm litter treatment (r = 0.4, p {$<$} 0.05 and r = 0.3, p {$<$} 0.05 for 3 cm and 8 cm litter, respectively). We conclude that species-specific effects on seedling establishment are mainly due to differences in seed mass, successional status, and light requirement for germination and that these factors thus influence species composition and diversity during abandoned fen grassland succession. Nach der Nutzungsaufgabe ist die Sukzession auf Feuchtgrünland-Brachen durch die Bildung mächtiger Streuauflagen gekennzeichnet. Durch Effekte auf Keimung und Etablierung beeinflusst die Streuauflage die Artenzusammensetzung und -vielfalt und wird deshalb als ein Schlüsselfaktor für die Vegetationsentwicklung angesehen. In einem Gewächshaus-Experiment wurde der Einfluss unterschiedlicher Streumächtigkeiten (Kontrolle, 3 cm und 8 cm) auf die abiotischen Faktoren Temperatur, Lichtintensität und Lichtqualität sowie auf die Keimlingsetablierung von 35 Grünlandarten untersucht. Die ausgewählten Arten unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich ihres Samengewichts (von 0,1 bis 4,8 mg) sowie ihres Verhaltens im Sukzessionsverlauf (Arten früher sowie später Sukzessionstadien). Weiterhin wurden die Zusammenhänge zwischen der Lichtbedürftigkeit der Keimung und dem Samengewicht, dem Verhalten im Sukzessionsverlauf und der Keimlingsetablierung unter Streuauflagen analysiert. Unter den Streuvarianten war die Lichtintensität signifikant niedriger als in der Kontrolle (Reduktion um 78\% und 91\% unter 3 und 8 cm Streuauflage). Das Hellrot/Dunkelrot-Verhältnis sank von 1,2 ohne Streuauflage auf 0,8 und 0,6 unter 3 bzw. 8 cm Streumächtigkeit. Die Keimlingsetablierung von 33 Arten wurde durch die Streu signifikant verringert. Die Etablierung von Arten mit einem hohen Samengewicht wurde weniger durch die Streuauflagen beeinflusst als diejenige kleinsamiger Arten (r = 0,62, p {$<$} 0,001 und r = 0,46, p {$<$} 0,01 für 3 cm und 8 cm Streumächtigkeit). Zusätzlich wurde (auch bei Berücksichtigung des Samengewichts als Kovariable) die Keimlingsetablierung von Arten früher Sukzessionsstadien stärker verringert als die von Arten später Sukzessionsstadien (ANCOVA: F = 7,6, p {$<$} 0,01). Weiterhin wurde ein positiver Zusammenhang zwischen dem Samengewicht und dem Keimungsprozentsatz im Dunkeln gefunden (r = 0,57, p {$<$} 0,001), was zeigt, dass kleinsamige Arten eine höhere Lichtbedürftigkeit für die Keimung aufweisen. Auch zwischen dem Anteil der Keimung im Dunkeln sowie der Keimlingsetablierung unter Streuauflagen wurden positive Zusammenhänge nachgewiesen (r = 0,4, p {$<$} 0,05 und r = 0,3, p {$<$} 0,05 für 3 cm bzw. 8 cm Streumächtigkeit). Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die artenspezifischen Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Keimlingsetablierung unter Streuauflagen im Wesentlichen durch die Faktoren Samengewicht, Lichtbedürftigkeit für die Keimung sowie das Sukzessionsverhalten erklärt werden können und dass diese Eigenschaften somit die Artenzusammensetzung und -vielfalt während der Sukzession auf Feuchtgrünland-Brachen beeinflussen.},

  abstract     = {Forest fires usually modify soil water repellency (SWR), and its persistence and intensity show a high variability both in space and time. This research studies the evolution of SWR in a Mediterranean calcareous soil affected by a forest fire, which occurred in Gorga (SE Spain) in July 2011, comparing the effect of the main vegetation cover between pine (Pinus halepensis) and shrubs species (Quercus coccifera, Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus albidus, Erica arborea and Brachypodium retusum) and the relationship with soil moisture content (SMC). Also the study analyzed the effect of ash on SWR dynamics under field conditions. Six plots were established on the fire-affected area and the unburned–control–adjacent area to monitoring SWR with the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test, SMC through moist sensors (5 cm depth) and three different ash treatments: ash presence, ash absence and incorporation of ash into the soil. An immediate increase of SWR was observed in the fire-affected area, mainly in pine plots. SWR changes in control (unburned) plots were quite similar between different types of vegetation influence, despite higher SWR values being observed on pine plots during the study period. A noticeable decrease of SWR was observed during the first months after fire in the affected areas, especially after the first rainy period, both in pine and shrubs plots. SWR increase was registered in all plots, and the highest levels were in March 2012 in burned pine plots. SWR decrease was higher in plots where ash was removed. Fireaffected soils became wettable 1 year and a half after the fire.},

However, investigations of land-management techniques, such as prescribed fire, often overlook responses of local fauna, particularly the arthropods. In this study, we examined a previously unappreciated, although potentially important, component of fire ecology by asking, does the timing of prescribed burns alter community structure of arthropods? At a site in the Texas Hill Country, we used sweep-net sampling to collected arthropods from experimental plots that had been treated with a summer-burn or winter-burn regime. Summer-burn plots supported {$>$}170\% more individual arthropods than winter burns. Although overall diversity of arthropods did not significantly differ between treatments, there were significantly more carnivorous arthropods and marginally more herbivorous arthropods after fire in summer relative to fire in winter. Effects of timing were particularly strong for Cicadellidae (leaf hoppers) and Tetragnathidae (long-jawed spiders). Our results demonstrate that timing of prescribed fire can substantially alter composition of resident communities of arthropods. Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of examining composition of the community, in addition to diversity indices, when assessing response of arthropods to land-management techniques.},

  abstract     = {Background: Forest, grass, and peat fires release approximately 2 petagrams of carbon into the atmosphere each year, influencing weather, climate, and air quality.
Objective: We estimated the annual global mortality attributable to landscape fire smoke (LFS).
Methods: Daily and annual exposure to particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) from fire emissions was estimated globally for 1997 through 2006 by combining outputs from a chemical transport model with satellite-based observations of aerosol optical depth. In World Health Organization (WHO) subregions classified as sporadically affected, the daily burden of mortality was estimated using previously published concentration–response coefficients for the association between short-term elevations in PM2.5 from LFS (contrasted with 0 μg/m3 from LFS) and all-cause mortality. In subregions classified as chronically affected, the annual burden of mortality was estimated using the American Cancer Society study coefficient for the association between longterm PM2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality. The annual average PM2.5 estimates were contrasted with theoretical minimum (counterfactual) concentrations in each chronically affected subregion. Sensitivity of mortality estimates to different exposure assessments, counterfactual estimates, and concentration–response functions was evaluated. Strong La Niña and El Niño years were compared to assess the influence of interannual climatic variability.
Results: Our principal estimate for the average mortality attributable to LFS exposure was 339,000 deaths annually. In sensitivity analyses the interquartile range of all tested estimates was 260,000–600,000. The regions most affected were sub-Saharan Africa (157,000) and Southeast Asia (110,000). Estimated annual mortality during La Niña was 262,000, compared with 532,000 during El Niño.
Conclusions: Fire emissions are an important contributor to global mortality. Adverse health outcomes associated with LFS could be substantially reduced by curtailing burning of tropical rainforests, which rarely burn naturally. The large estimated influence of El Niño suggests a relationship between climate and the burden of mortality attributable to LFS.},

  abstract = {A field study was conducted in order to study the effects of different wildfire severities on [1] soil organic matter content, [2] soil water repellency, and [3] aggregate stability; [4] the distribution of soil water repellency in aggregate sieve fractions (1–2, 0.5–1, 0.25–0.5 and {$<$}0.25mm) was also studied. Five similar burned sites and two long-unburned control sites were selected under mixed fir and pine forests in volcanic highlands from Michoacán, Mexico. Soil water repellency was observed in soil samples from all sites, although changes were influenced by fire severity. Sites affected by low severity fires did not show important changes in burned soils in comparison with controls, while high severity fires caused different responses: water repellency was increased or destroyed probably due to temperatures below or above 200–250°C during burning. The degree of wettability/repellency from the fine earth fraction of burned soils seems to be conditioned by {$<$}0.5mm aggregates, more than coarser aggregates which always showed a higher degree of wettability. It is suggested that destruction of organic matter during burning occurs principally in coarse aggregates, where combustion can be more intense. Aggregate stability (measured using pre-wetted aggregates between 4 and 4.8mm) did not change under low severity burning but it was considerably reduced in the case of a high fire severity. Losses of organic matter and destruction of water repellency seem to be the reasons for that reduction in this type of soil in contrast to previous studies, where aggregate stability increased after burning. Changes in both properties (water repellency and aggregate stability) are expected to induce modifications in runoff and soil loss rates at the hillslope scale.},

Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDThe movement of animals makes them fascinating but difficult study subjects. Animal movements underpin many biological phenomena, and understanding them is critical for applications in conservation, health, and food. Traditional approaches to animal tracking used field biologists wielding antennas to record a few dozen locations per animal, revealing only the most general patterns of animal space use. The advent of satellite tracking automated this process, but initially was limited to larger animals and increased the resolution of trajectories to only a few hundred locations per animal. The last few years have shown exponential improvement in tracking technology, leading to smaller tracking devices that can return millions of movement steps for ever-smaller animals. Finally, we have a tool that returns high-resolution data that reveal the detailed facets of animal movement and its many implications for biodiversity, animal ecology, behavior, and ecosystem function.
ADVANCESImproved technology has brought animal tracking into the realm of big data, not only through high-resolution movement trajectories, but also through the addition of other on-animal sensors and the integration of remote sensing data about the environment through which these animals are moving. These new data are opening up a breadth of new scientific questions about ecology, evolution, and physiology and enable the use of animals as sensors of the environment. High–temporal resolution movement data also can document brief but important contacts between animals, creating new opportunities to study social networks, as well as interspecific interactions such as competition and predation. With solar panels keeping batteries charged, “lifetime” tracks can now be collected for some species, while broader approaches are aiming for species-wide sampling across multiple populations. Miniaturized tags also help reduce the impact of the devices on the study subjects, improving animal welfare and scientific results. As in other disciplines, the explosion of data volume and variety has created new challenges and opportunities for information management, integration, and analysis. In an exciting interdisciplinary push, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists have begun to develop new tools that are already leading to new insights and scientific breakthroughs.
OUTLOOKWe suggest that a golden age of animal tracking science has begun and that the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented exciting discoveries. Technology continues to improve our ability to track animals, with the promise of smaller tags collecting more data, less invasively, on a greater variety of animals. The big-data tracking studies that are just now being pioneered will become commonplace. If analytical developments can keep pace, the field will be able to develop real-time predictive models that integrate habitat preferences, movement abilities, sensory capacities, and animal memories into movement forecasts. The unique perspective offered by big-data animal tracking enables a new view of animals as naturally evolved sensors of environment, which we think has the potential to help us monitor the planet in completely new ways. A massive multi-individual monitoring program would allow a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups, providing new insight on our world through the sixth sense of the global animal collective. We expect that the field will soon reach a transformational point where these studies do more than inform us about particular species of animals, but allow the animals to teach us about the world. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/348/6240/aaa2478/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Big-data animal tracking.The red trajectory shows how studies can now track animals with unprecedented detail, allowing researchers to predict the causes and consequences of movements, and animals to become environmental sensors. Multisensor tracking tags monitor movement, behavior, physiology, and environmental context. Geo- and biosciences merge now using a multitude of remote-sensing data. Understanding how social and interspecific interactions affect movement is the next big frontier.
Moving animals connect our world, spreading pollen, seeds, nutrients, and parasites as they go about the their daily lives. Recent integration of high-resolution Global Positioning System and other sensors into miniaturized tracking tags has dramatically improved our ability to describe animal movement. This has created opportunities and challenges that parallel big data transformations in other fields and has rapidly advanced animal ecology and physiology. New analytical approaches, combined with remotely sensed or modeled environmental information, have opened up a host of new questions on the causes of movement and its consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals is leading to new insights on species interactions and, scaled up, may enable distributed monitoring of both animals and our changing environment.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the historical range and variability of landscape composition and structure using simulation modeling is becoming an important means of assessing current landscape condition and prioritizing landscapes for ecosystem restoration. However, most simulated time series are generated using static climate conditions which fail to account for the predicted major changes in future climate. This paper presents a simulation study that generates reference landscape compositions for all combinations of three climate scenarios (warm-wet, hot-dry, and current) and three fire regime scenarios (half historical, historical, and double historical fire frequencies) to determine if future climate change has an effect on landscape dynamics. We applied the spatially explicit, state-and-transition, landscape fire succession model LANDSUM to two large landscapes in west-central Montana, USA. LANDSUM was parameterized and initialized using spatial data generated from the LANDFIRE prototype project. Biophysical settings, critical spatial inputs to LANDSUM, were empirically modeled across the landscape using environmental gradients created from historical and modeled future climate daily weather data summaries. Successional pathways and disturbance probabilities were assigned to these biophysical settings based on existing field data and extensive literature reviews. To assess the impact of changes in climate and fire regime, we compared simulated area burned and landscape composition over time among the different simulation scenario combinations using response variables of Sorenson’s index (a global measure of similarity) and area occupied by the dominant vegetation class (simple indicator of change in landscape composition). Results show that simulated time series using future predicted climate scenarios are significantly different from the simulated historical time series and any changes in the fire regime tend to create more dissimilar and more variable simulated time series. Our study results indicate that historical time series should be used in conjunction with simulated future time series as references for managing landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

This paper is meant as a reference on the strengths and limitations of applying HRV in land management. Applications of the HRV concept have specific contexts, constraints, and conditions that are relevant to any application and are influential to the extent to which the concept is applied.

  abstract     = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

Distinguishing between traits that are adaptations originating in response to fire or exaptations originating in response to other factors might not always be possible.

  abstract     = {State and federal agencies have reported fire causes since the early 1900s, explicitly for the purpose of helping land managers design fire-prevention programs. We document fire-ignition patterns in five homogenous climate divisions in California over the past 98 years on state Cal Fire protected lands and 107 years on federal United States Forest Service lands. Throughout the state, fire frequency increased steadily until a peak c. 1980, followed by a marked drop to 2016. There was not a tight link between frequency of ignition sources and area burned by those sources and the relationships have changed over time. Natural lightning-ignited fires were consistently fewer from north to south and from high to low elevation. Throughout most of the state, human-caused fires dominated the record and were positively correlated with population density for the first two-thirds of the record, but this relationship reversed in recent decades. We propose a mechanistic multi-variate model of factors driving fire frequency, where the importance of different factors has changed over time. Although ignition sources have declined markedly in recent decades, one notable exception is powerline ignitions. One important avenue for future fire-hazard reduction will be consideration of solutions to reduce this source of dangerous fires.},

  abstract     = {The effects of burning on the levels of soil organic matter, soil nitrogen, and soil microbial biomass were studied by carrym' g out experimental shiftingcultivation at two sites, Niah and Bakam in Sarawak, Malaysia. Vegetation biomass was burned in plots (lox10m2) at the rates of 0 (control), 100,200, and 300Mg ha-' at the Niah site and 0,20,and 100M g ha-' at the Bakam site. At the Niah site, the levels of total C and N of the soils did not change throughout the experiment in spite of enhanced soil respiration until 2 months after burning. Although burning induced an increase in the amount of NH,-N of the soils,the readily available pool of N (the sum of the NH4-N,NO,-N, microbial biomass N, and extractable organic N pools) in the burned plots was depleted appreciably at the end of rice cultivation. The effects of burning on these properties tended to be substantial with increasing amounts of the vegetation biomass burned. On the other hand, the levels of total C and N and the readily available N pool at the Bakam site were low before burning compared with those at the Niah site, and the burning treatments did not afPect them appreciably. While the rice yield at the Niah site reached the average value obtained in traditional shiftingcultivation in Sarawak, that at the Bakam site was much lower. It was suggested that the flush of NH4-Ninduced by burning was one of the major factors for rice growth.},

The effect of treatments on plant growth was tested using a shade intolerant tree species (Anadenanthera colubrina Vell. Conc.) as a bioassay. Surface soils in high-intensity fire treatments had significantly greater pH values, concentrations of extractable calcium (Ca), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and phosphorus (P), and amounts of resin-available P and nitrogen (N) than other treatments; however, a loss of soil organic matter during high-intensity fires likely resulted in increased bulk density and strength, and decreased water infiltration rates. Low intensity fires also significantly increased soil pH, concentrations of extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P, and amounts of resin-available P and N, although to a lesser degree than high-intensity fires. Low-intensity fires did not lower soil organic matter contents or alter soil physical properties. Plant removal and harvesting gap treatments had little effect on soil chemical and physical properties. Despite the potentially negative effects of degraded soil structure on plant growth, growth of A. colubrina seedlings were greater following high-intensity fires. Evidently, the increase in nutrient availability caused by high-intensity fires was not offset by degraded soil structure in its effects on seedling growth. Long-term effects of high intensity fires require further research.},

  abstract     = {The fire-dependent longleaf pine?wiregrass (Pinus palustris Mill.?Aristida beyrichiana Trin. \& Rupr.) savannas of the southeastern United States provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between productivity and species richness in a natural ecosystem because of the extremely high number of species and their range across a wide ecological amplitude (sandhills to edges of wetlands). We used a natural gradient to examine how plant species richness and plant community structure vary with standing crop biomass (which in this system is proportional to annual net productivity) as a function of soil moisture and nitrogen mineralization rates in a frequently burned longleaf pine?wiregrass savanna. Highest ground cover biomass and highest species richness were found at the same position along the gradient, the wet-mesic sites. Relative differences in species richness among site types were independent of scale, ranging from 0.01 m2 to 100 m2. Nitrogen availability was negatively correlated with species richness. Dominance of wiregrass (in terms of biomass) was consistent across the gradient and not correlated with species richness. Regardless of site type, the community structure of the savannas was characterized by many perennial species with infrequent occurrences, a factor in the low temporal heterogeneity (percent similarity between seasons and years) and high within-site spatial heterogeneity (percent dissimilarity of vegetation composition). The coexistence of numerous species is likely due to the high frequency of fire that removes competing hardwood vegetation and litter and to the suite of fire-adapted perennial species that, once established, are able to persist. Our results suggest that soil moisture is an important factor regulating both the number of species present and community production within the defined gradient of this study.},

Ninety days after the burn microbial biomass N was highest in the controls, followed by the wet and then the dry-burned soils, in both the pinyon and juniper microcosms.

While local studies have found more fires close to settlements and roads, assimilated charcoal records and analyses of regional fire patterns from remote-sensing observations point to a decline in fire frequency with increasing human population. Here, we present a global analysis using three multi-year satellitebased burned-area products combined with a parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis with a non-linear model. We show that at the global scale, the impact of increasing population density is mainly to reduce fire frequency. Only for areas with up to 0.1 people per km2, we find that fire frequency increases by 10 to 20 \% relative to its value at no population. The results are robust against choice of burned-area data set, and indicate that at only very few places on earth, fire frequency is limited by human ignitions. Applying the results to historical population estimates results in a moderate but accelerating decline of global burned area by around 14 \% since 1800, with most of the decline since 1950.},

  abstract     = {Wildfires are an important component of terrestrial ecosystem ecology but also a major natural hazard to societies, and their frequency and spatial distribution must be better understood. At a given location, risk from wildfire is associated with the annual fraction of burned area, which is expected to increase in response to climate warming. Until recently, however, only a few global studies of future fire have considered the effects of other important global environmental change factors such as atmospheric CO2 levels and human activities, and how these influence fires in different regions. Here, we contrast the impact of climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 content on burned area with that of demographic dynamics, using ensembles of climate simulations combined with historical and projected population changes under different socio-economic development pathways for 1901-2100. Historically, humans notably suppressed wildfires. For future scenarios, global burned area will continue to decline under a moderate emissions scenario, except for low population growth and fast urbanization, but start to increase again from around mid-century under high greenhouse gas emissions. Contrary to common perception, we find that human exposure to wildfires increases in the future mainly owing to projected population growth in areas with frequent wildfires, rather than by a general increase in burned area.},

  abstract     = {Wildfire disturbance is one of the most prevalent forces of ecological change in freshwater environments. Studies of stream temperature responses to wildfire disturbance are often limited to individual watersheds or burn events, resulting in an incomplete understanding of: 1) how wildfires affect stream temperature at broader spatial scales and 2) which environmental and pyrological factors are important predictors of thermal responses. We analyzed long-term temperature monitoring data from 18 fire-affected streams across the Pacific Northwest. We used a nonparametric effect-size approach to quantify response patterns among 26 metrics describing the thermal regime (magnitude, variability, frequency, and timing of thermal events) in the 1st postfire year. We used multivariate ordination and spatially explicit data on pyrological, hydrological, and meteorological conditions to identify potential drivers of thermal sensitivity to wildfire effects in disturbed watersheds. Thermal responses were highly variable at the site level, but, in general, streams of the Pacific Northwest are prone to increased frequency of warmer temperatures and decreased frequency of cooler temperatures in the year after a wildfire. Redundancy analysis showed that 30 to 55\% of the variation in stream temperature responses was equally explained by pyrological, hydrological, and meteorological conditions. Mean annual precipitation, \% watershed burned, and mean annual flow were primary factors shaping thermal response to wildfire, but the relative importance of these potential drivers varied among aspects of the thermal regime. Our study provides new insight into the regional influence of wildfire on stream thermal regimes and indicates that wildfire could exacerbate climate-induced warming in streams. Further investigation of the interactions among wildfire, hydrology, and climatic processes and enhanced stream network monitoring are needed to manage fresh waters in a future characterized by more severe and frequent wildfire activity.},

  abstract = {Fire is one of the most important natural disturbances in the boreal forest. It strongly influences boreal forest structure and function, and alters microbial biomass and species composition e.g. by significantly reducing the abundance of decomposing fungi. We measured carbon stocks and estimated fungal biomass and soil carbon turnover in Pinus sylvestris stands on a fire chronosequence from 2 to 152 years post-fire. Results show that the turnover time of soil carbon was longest in the area where fire occurred 2 years ago (117 years) and approximately two times shorter (ca. 60 years) in the areas where fire occurred 42, 60 and 152 years ago. The soil carbon turnover time in our study areas was associated with very slow fungal biomass recovery. The fungal biomass (ergosterol content), soil carbon content and soil CO2 efflux reached the same levels as in the oldest site approximately 60 years after the fire. Our results indicate that the slow multi-decadal post-fire recovery of fungal biomass drives the soil carbon balance of boreal forests, and disturbances such as fires have a profound influence on soil carbon turnover for decades. On the other hand, the longer post-fire residence time of carbon in the soil compared to older forests suggests that fire effects on the soil carbon pool in boreal forests might be less dramatic than previously thought.},

In this study we measured enzymatic activities, litter decomposition rates, carbon stocks and fungal and microbial biomasses in a boreal subarctic coniferous forest on a four age classes of non-stand replacing fire chronosequence (2, 42, 60 and 152 years after the fire). The results show that microbial activity recovered slowly after fire and the decomposition of new litter was affected by the disturbance. The percent mass loss of Scots pine litter increased with time from the last fire. Slow litter decomposition during the first post-fire years accelerates soil organic matter accumulation that is essential for the recovery of soil biological activities. Fire reduced the enzymatic activity across all the enzyme types measured. Carbon-degrading, chitin-degrading and phosphorus-dissolving enzymes showed different responses with the time elapsed since the fire disturbance. Microbial and enzymatic activity took decades before recovering to the levels observed in old forest stands. Our study demonstrates that slower post-fire litter decomposition has a pronounced impact on the recovery of soil organic matter following forest fires in northern boreal coniferous forests.},

To address this deficiency, we burned constructed fuelbeds from masticated sites in pine flatwoods forests in northern Florida with palmetto-dominated understoreys and examined the effects of fuel load and fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire behaviour. Flame lengths (49–140 cm) and fireline intensity (183–773 kJ mÀ1 sÀ1) increased with loading (10–30 Mg haÀ1) and were reduced by 40 and 47\% with increasing FMC from 9 to 13\%. Rate of spread was not influenced by fuel load, but doubled under drier FMC. Fuel consumption was .90\% for all burns. Soil temperatures were influenced by both fuel load and FMC, but never reached lethal temperatures (608C). However, temperatures of thermocouple probes placed at the fuelbed surface reached 274–5038C. Probe maximum temperature and duration at temperatures \$608C (9.5–20.08C min) both increased with fuel load, but were unaffected by FMC. The fire behaviour observed in these unique litter-dominated fuelbeds provides additional insight into the burning characteristics of masticated fuels in general.},

This study reports changes in total carbon (TC) and PyC in the litter (as char particles) and the top 2 cm of soil (as oxidation resistant carbon, PyC) in Eucalyptus obliqua forests in south-eastern Australia. Litter and surface soil were sampled and carbon (C) measured before and immediately after low intensity prescribed fire on the same sites. Post-fire, lightly burnt (FIRE-300) and heavily burnt (FIRE-600) forest floor areas were sampled separately. On average, net loss of 1.55 Mg haÀ1 C (10\% of initial) from litter was largely offset by increase of 1.67 Mg haÀ1 C in soil (which was restricted to the 0–2 cm layer) with no net change in the initial litter + soil C stock of 21.9 Mg haÀ1 C. Concurrently, fire increased PyC by 0.3 Mg haÀ1 in litter and 0.4 Mg haÀ1 in surface soil, which together were equivalent to about 11\% of the 6.1 Mg haÀ1 C emitted to the atmosphere as a result of the prescribed burn.},

  abstract     = {Madagascar has a fire problem: despite a century of anti-fire repression and rhetoric, farmers and herders continue burning about half of the island’s grasslands and woodlands annually. The state criminalized burning due to concern that fire destroys the island’s natural resources and blocks development. Many peasants, however, rely on fire to maintain pastures and woodlands, prepare cropfields, control pests, and manage wildfires. The resultant conflict over natural resource management provides a convenient window into questions of peasant protest and resistance, and into strategies of power in resource management. Peasants have succeeded in continuing to burn unimpeded, leading to a century-long stalemate over fire, by taking advantage of first, contradictions and hesitations within the state, second, the natural character of fire (its inevitability, easy anonymity, and self-propagation), and third, the ambiguity between fire as explicit protest and fire as a livelihood technique used at politically opportune moments. This research demonstrates that models of domination (or criminalization) and resistance used to understand peasant-state relations in natural resource management are incomplete without, first, a consideration of the complex and ambiguous spaces between domination and resistance, between state and peasant, between protest and livelihood practices, and second, attention to the political-ecological context including resource ecology, rural livelihoods, and political discourse.},

Methods: A questionnaire was used to assess smoke exposure and occurrence of symptoms among CHS high-school students (n ϭ 873; age, 17–18 yr) and elementary-school children (n ϭ 5,551; age, 6–7 yr), in a total of 16 communities. Estimates of particulate matter (PM10) concentrations during the 5 d with the highest fire activity were used to characterize community smoke level. Main Results: All symptoms (nose, eyes, and throat irritations; cough; bronchitis; cold; wheezing; asthma attacks), medication usage, and physician visits were associated with individually reported exposure differences within communities. Risks increased monotonically with the number of reported smoky days. For most outcomes, reporting rates between communities were also associated with the firerelated PM10 levels. Associations tended to be strongest among those without asthma. Individuals with asthma were more likely to take preventive action, such as wearing masks or staying indoors during the fire.
Conclusions: Exposure to wildfire smoke was associated with increased eye and respiratory symptoms, medication use, and physician visits.},

  abstract = {A stage-by-stage protocol for identifying simple or biased lottery, or non-lottery, patterns of seedling recruitment is outlined. For a simple (weighted) lottery to apply, the proportion of total individuals accounted for by one species at one stage of recruitment plotted against the proportion accounted for at a previous stage over a wide range of recruitment conditions should obey a linear regression with a=0 and b=1. For a biased lottery to hold, the regression is significant but a≠0 and/or b≠1. Demorgraphic, size and water relations data were collected over 3 years for four co-occurring Banksia species following two contrasting experimental fires. The first summer was exceptionally wet and the second was exceptionally hot and dry. Seedlings still alive by the 3rd year relative to the fire-killed parent plants conformed to a biased lottery in the case of B. speciosa and B. baxteri, while B. coccinea and B. pulchella had no mathematical structure (mean of the proportional ratios ≠ 1). Intervening stages, beginning with seed release, showed transient deterministic or simple lottery patterns in some cases, but the overriding trend was for biased lotteries. B. speciosa dominated the responses, with greater seed release than expected, fewer initial seedlings, lottery survival of 1st year seedlings and greater survival of 2nd year seedlings, when compared with the previous stages. Large seeds and subsequent high growth rates enabled B. speciosa to exploit soil water preferentially during the severe summer drought. The trend for B. speciosa to replace other species may be cancelled by stochastic processes not operating in this particular study.},

Using outcomes of trait assignments applied to molecular phylogenies for fire-stimulated flowering, seed-release, and germination, in this Opinion article we show that fire-proneness precedes, or rarely coincides with, the evolution of these fire-adapted traits. In addition, fire remains central to understanding germination promoted by smoke among species occurring in non-fire-prone environments because of the historical association of their clade with fire. Fire-mimicking selection and associated exaptations have no place in understanding the evolution of fire-adapted traits because we find no support for any reversal in the fire–trait sequence through time.},

  abstract     = {A severe wildfire burnt over 1 million ha of forested land in southeastern Australia in early 2003. Included in the burnt area were two 136 and 244 ha hydrologic research catchments in the East Kiewa valley that had been decommissioned following a 10 year study, and an adjacent larger (10,050 ha) gauged catchment, the West Kiewa River. The three catchments were re-instrumented to measure discharge and suspended sediment fluxes at 15 min timesteps, with additional measurement of bedload at the East Kiewa sites. Analysis of annual rainfall–discharge relationships and of flow duration curves for the first 2 post-fire water years indicated annual flow increases of around 65–75\% for Slippery Rock Creek in both post-fire water years and 40\% and 76–94\% for Springs Creek in 2003–2004 and 2004–2005, respectively. The flow impacts on the less severely burnt West Kiewa River were far more subdued, and did not exceed pre-fire variability in annual flows. Flow duration curve analysis did not indicate changed runoff generating processes at the daily timescale, with the curves shifting upward uniformly over the flow regime. Total sediment exports increased by factors of 8–9 (up to 2.96 t haÀ1 yrÀ1) from the East Kiewa catchments in year 1 after the fire, diminishing to a 2–4-fold increase in year 2. Flow increases accounted for much of the year 2 exports as suspended sediment concentrations decreased toward pre-fire levels. Post-fire suspended load exports from the larger West Kiewa catchment were much lower per unit area, probably reflecting the smaller area of high intensity burn, less intensive burning of riparian areas and possible scale effects. The results were observed under near-average rainfall conditions, with the exception of one short duration high intensity storm that produced almost 50\% of the combined sediment loads from the East Kiewa catchments.},

  abstract = {After wildfire a hitherto unexplained erosion process that some authors have called ‘miniature debris flows on hillslopes’ and that leave behind levee-lined rills has been observed in some regions of the world. Despite the unusual proposition of debris flow on planar hillslopes, the process has not received much attention. The objectives of this study were to (1) accumulate observational evidence of Hillslope Debris Flows (HDF) as we have defined the process, to (2) understand their initiation process by conducting runoff experiments on hillslopes, to (3) propose a conceptual model of HDF, and to (4) contrast and classify HDF relative to other erosion and transport processes in the post-wildfire hillslope domain. HDF have been observed at relatively steep slope gradients (0.4–0.8), on a variety of geologies, and after fire of at least moderate severity and consist of a lobe of gravel- to cobble-sized material 0.2–1 m wide that is pushed by runoff damming up behind it. During initiation, runoff moved individual particles that accumulated a small distance downslope until the accumulation of grains failed and formed the granular lobe of the HDF. HDF are a threshold process, and runoff rates of 0.5 L s− 1 2 L s− 1 were required for their initiation during the experiments. The conceptual model highlights HDF as a geomorphic process distinct from channel debris flows, because they occur on planar, unconfined hillslopes rather than confined channels. HDF can erode very coarse non-cohesive surface soil, which distinguishes them from rill erosion that have suspended and bedload transport. On a matrix of slope and grain size, HDF are enveloped between purely gravity-driven dry ravel, and mostly runoff driven bedload transport in rills.},

The impact of vegetation fire emissions on air pollution and climate has been recognised in the late 1970s. The application of satellite data for fire-related studies in the beginning of the 21th century represented a major break through in our understanding of the global importance of fires. Today the location and extent of vegetation fires, burned area and emissions released from fires are determined from satellite products even though many uncertainties persist. Numerous dedicated experimental and modeling studies contributed to improve the current knowledge of the atmospheric impact of vegetation fires. The motivation of this paper is to give an overview of vegetation fire emissions, their environmental and climate impact, and what improvements can be expected in the near future.},

Flashes were grouped into thunderstorms based on their closeness both in time and space. Information on location, time of ignition and cause of all forest fires as recorded by chiefs of local fire brigades during this 5-year period were also used. Fires judged to be ignited by lightning were linked to strokes occurring within 10 km and 50 h of ignition. The probability that a stroke had ignited a particular fire was computed based on the distance between the two in time and space and on the number of other strokes that might have ignited the same fire. Our results show that positive and negative strokes ignite with equal probability. Increasing number of strokes per flash, hereafter referred to as ‘‘multiplicity’’ of flashes tended to decrease ignition probability of a stroke. Strokes in long-lasting and intense thunderstorms are less likely to cause ignition than strokes in local, small-scale thunderstorms.

Such information is lacking for tropical agroforestry trees. Reserve carbohydrate trends were examined in uncut, 12-year-old multipurpose trees in the seasonally dry climate of Ibadan, Nigeria. Species included Dactyladenia barteri, Gliricidia sepium, Leucaena leucocephala, Pterocarpus soyauxii, and Senna siamea. Definite seasonal trends were observed. Concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates (sugar+starch) were highest during the dry season. Starch had two maxima, one early in the dry season, and one early in the wet season. Conversion of starch to sugar seemed to occur as trees developed drought tolerance. All carbohydrate values decreased as active growth resumed during the wet season. In general, all carbohydrate values were relatively low as active growth continued; they increased only when dry weather slowed growth. In several species, carbohydrate concentrations in the lower boles decreased during reproductive growth, especially during the last phase of fruit maturation. Significant linear correlations were found between concentrations of sugar and total reserve carbohydrates and a number of weather variables — rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation. Correlations with starch were much lower than for sugar, although several were significant, suggesting that seasonal trends in starch are too complex to be described adequately by linear correlations.},

  abstract     = {Remote ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA provide valuable examples of reference conditions due to their relatively uninterrupted fire regimes, limited grazing history, and protection from logging. Wildfire is an important disturbance agent in upland forests of the Interior West, yet repeated measurements taken before and after lightning-ignited fires are rare. In 1999, a low-severity Wildland Fire Use fire burned 156 ha on Fire Point, a peninsula dominated by old-growth ponderosa pines, which had not burned for at least 76 years. We measured understory plant community and forest floor characteristics in 1998 (1 year before the fire) and 2001 (2 years after the fire) at this site and at nearby reference sites that did not burn in 1999 but have had continuing fire regimes throughout the past century. After the wildfire, the plant community at Fire Point shifted toward higher compositional similarity with the reference sites. Analysis of functional group composition indicated that this change was due primarily to an increase in annual and biennial forbs. Gayophytum diffusum, Polygonum douglasii, Chenopodium spp., Solidago spp., Elymus elymoides, Calochortus nuttallii, Hesperostipa comata, and Lotus spp. were indicative of forests influenced by recent fires. Species richness, plant cover, plant layer density and plant diversity were significantly lower at Fire Point than at the reference sites, possibly due to long-term fire exclusion, but the fire did not increase the rate of change in these variables after 2 years. Few exotic species were present at any site. Forest floor depths at Fire Point were reduced to depths similar to the reference sites, primarily due to consumption of the duff layer. There was a significant inverse relationship between the ratio of duff:litter and species richness. Compared to fireexcluded forests, old-growth ponderosa pine forests influenced by low-intensity surface fires generally have greater plant species richness (especially annual forbs) and lighter fuel loads. This study supports the continued application of the Wildland Fire Use strategy in old-growth montane forests to maintain and improve forest health by altering understory species composition and reducing fuel loads.},

  abstract = {Abstract Fire, a frequent disturbance in the Mediterranean, affects pollinator communities. We explored the response of major pollinator guilds to fire severity, across a fire-severity gradient at different spatial scales. We show that the abundance of all pollinator groups responded to fire severity, and that bees and beetles showed in addition a significant species-diversity response. Bees, sawflies, and wasps responded to fire severity at relatively small spatial scales (250?300~m), whereas flies and beetles responded at larger spatial scales. The response of bees, sawflies, and wasps was unimodal, as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, whereas flies and beetles showed a negative response. A possible explanation is that the observed patterns (spatial scale and type of response) are driven by taxa-specific ecological and life-history traits, such as nesting preference and body size, as well as the availability of resources in the postfire landscape. Our observational study provides an insight into the effect of fire severity on pollinators. However, future research exploring the explicit link between the pre- and postfire landscape structure and pollinator traits and responses is required for further establishment and understanding of cause?effect relationships.},

  abstract     = {Ungulates influence ecosystem services in important ways, including by altering the amount of standing plant biomass and species composition. Browsing, for example, removes biomass and, in consequence, can decrease the risk of wildfires. The influence of ungulates on carbon storage is more complicated. Browsers reduce carbon stocks directly by consuming biomass, but if browsing reduces fine fuel loads, then long-term carbon storage may increase. We investigated how wild ungulates mediate trade-offs between carbon stocks and wildfire hazard in a Mediterranean oak woodland. We assessed the effects of deer (Cervus elaphus and Dama dama) on the colonization by gum cistus (Cistus ladanifer), a highly flammable Mediterranean shrub, through a long-term ungulate exclusion experiment. We established fenced (unbrowsed) and open (browsed) plots in areas where shrubs were previously cleared, and compared shrub density, height, biomass, and above-ground carbon stocks 6 and 14~years after fencing. There were no significant differences in shrub density between treatments after 6~years of browsing exclusion but, by this point, height was already significantly greater in fenced plots. At the end of the experiment, shrub density and height were both significantly greater in fenced plots. Biomass and carbon stocks of gum cistus increased and reached a plateau in fenced plots, while in open plots biomass and carbon stocks increased initially but then decreased. Ungulates also prevented accumulation of litter carbon stocks, which was significantly higher in fenced plots after 14~years of browsing exclusion. We also modelled fire behaviour in fenced and open plots. Browsing reduced fine fuel load, an important contributor to fire spread, by 80\%. In browsed plots, modelled wildfire rate of spread, flame length, and fireline intensity decreased by 50\%, 65\%, and 90\%, respectively, which also decreased the probability of canopy fire and of oak mortality. Synthesis and applications. By decreasing fire hazard and the probability of canopy fire, ungulates may ultimately increase ecosystem carbon stocks through improved adult oak survival. These critical, indirect trade-offs need to be assessed when addressing the effects of ungulates on ecosystems and the management of their populations.},

We construct a habitat equivalency model under which fuels management activities, actions commonly undertaken to reduce the frequency and/or severity of wildland fire, are used to compensate for climate change-induced losses in ecosystem services on conservation lands in the contiguous U.S. resulting from wildland fire. The benefit of the greenhouse gas mitigation policy is equal to the difference in fuels management costs between the reference and policy scenarios. Results suggest present value ecosystem service benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation on the average of \$3.5 billion (2005 dollars, assuming a three percent discount rate). Our analysis highlights the importance of considering loss of ecosystem services when evaluating the impacts of alternative greenhouse gas mitigation policies.},

  abstract     = {Viewing the universe as being composed of hierarchically arranged systems is widely accepted as a useful model of reality. In ecology, three levels of organization are generally recognized: organisms, populations, and communities (biocoenoses). For half a century increasing numbers of ecologists have concluded that recognition of a fourth level would facilitate increased understanding of ecological phenomena. Sometimes the word “ecosystem” is used for this level, but this is arguably inappropriate. Since 1986, I and others have argued that the term “landscape” would be a suitable term for a level of organization defined as an ecological system containing more than one community type. However, “landscape” and “landscape level” continue to be used extensively by ecologists in the popular sense of a large expanse of space. I therefore now propose that the term “ecoscape” be used instead for this fourth level of organization. A clearly defined fourth level for ecology would focus attention on the emergent properties of this level, and maintain the spatial and temporal scale-free nature inherent in this hierarchy of organizational levels for living entities.},

  abstract     = {The historical and presettlement relationships between drought and wildfire are well documented in North America, with forest fire occurrence and area clearly increasing in response to drought. There is also evidence that drought interacts with other controls (forest productivity, topography, fire weather, management activities) to affect fire intensity, severity, extent, and frequency. Fire regime characteristics arise across many individual fires at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, so both weather and climate – including short- and long-term droughts – are important and influence several, but not all, aspects of fire regimes. We review relationships between drought and fire regimes in United States forests, fire-related drought metrics and expected changes in fire risk, and implications for fire management under climate change. Collectively, this points to a conceptual model of fire on real landscapes: fire regimes, and how they change through time, are products of fuels and how other factors affect their availability (abundance, arrangement, continuity) and flammability (moisture, chemical composition). Climate, management, and land use all affect availability, flammability, and probability of ignition differently in different parts of North America. From a fire ecology perspective, the concept of drought varies with scale, application, scientific or management objective, and ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {Increasing wildfire activity in recent decades, partially related to extended droughts, along with concern over potential impacts of future climate change on fire activity has resulted in increased attention on fire–climate interactions. Findings from studies published in recent years have remarkably increased our understanding of fire–climate interactions and improved our capacity to delineate probable future climate change and impacts. Fires are projected to increase in many regions of the globe under a changing climate due to the greenhouse effect. Burned areas in the western US could increase by more than 50\% by the middle of this century. Increased fire activity is not simply an outcome of the changing climate, but also a participant in the change. Smoke particles reduce overall solar radiation absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere during individual fire events and fire seasons, leading to regional climate effects including reduction in surface temperature, suppression of cloud and precipitation, and enhancement of climate anomalies such as droughts. Black carbon (BC) in smoke particles displays some different radiation and climate effects by warming the middle and lower atmosphere, leading to a more stable atmosphere. BC also plays a key role in the smoke-snow feedback mechanism. Fire emissions of CO2, on the other hand, are an important atmospheric CO2 source and contribute substantially to the global greenhouse effect. Future studies should generate a global picture of all aspects of radiative forcing by smoke particles. Better knowledge is needed in space and time variability of smoke particles, evolution of smoke optical properties, estimation of smoke plume height and vertical profiles and their impacts on locations of warming layers, stability structure, clouds and smoke transport, quantification of BC emission factors and optical properties from different forest fuels, and BC’s individual and combined roles with organic carbon. Finally, understanding the short- and long-term greenhouse effect of fire CO2 emissions, increased capacity to project future fire trends (especially mega-fires), with consideration of climate–fuel–human interactions, and improved fire weather and climate prediction skills (including exploring the SST-fire relations) remain central knowledge needs.},

  abstract     = {Background: Climate change is likely to increase the threat of wildfires, and little is known about how wildfires affect health in exposed communities. A better understanding of the impacts of the resulting air pollution has important public health implications for the present day and the future.
Method: We performed a systematic search to identify peer-reviewed scientific studies published since 1986 regarding impacts of wildfire smoke on health in exposed communities. We reviewed and synthesized the state of science of this issue including methods to estimate exposure, and identified limitations in current research.
Results: We identified 61 epidemiological studies linking wildfire and human health in communities. The U.S. and Australia were the most frequently studied countries (18 studies on the U.S., 15 on Australia). Geographic scales ranged from a single small city (population about 55,000) to the entire globe. Most studies focused on areas close to fire events. Exposure was most commonly assessed with stationary air pollutant monitors (35 of 61 studies). Other methods included using satellite remote sensing and measurements from air samples collected during fires. Most studies compared risk of health outcomes between 1) periods with no fire events and periods during or after fire events, or 2) regions affected by wildfire smoke and unaffected regions. Daily pollution levels during or after wildfire in most studies exceeded U.S. EPA regulations. Levels of PM10, the most frequently studied pollutant, were 1.2 to 10 times higher due to wildfire smoke compared to non-fire periods and/or locations. Respiratory disease was the most frequently studied health condition, and had the most consistent results. Over 90\% of these 45 studies reported that wildfire smoke was significantly associated with risk of respiratory morbidity.
Conclusion: Exposure measurement is a key challenge in current literature on wildfire and human health. A limitation is the difficulty of estimating pollution specific to wildfires. New methods are needed to separate air pollution levels of wildfires from those from ambient sources, such as transportation. The majority of studies found that wildfire smoke was associated with increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Children, the elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases appear to be susceptible. More studies on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are needed. Further exploration with new methods could help ascertain the public health impacts of wildfires under climate change and guide mitigation policies.},

  abstract     = {Background

Wildfire and topography each have significant effects on soil biogeochemical cycles, but their interactive effects on soil nutrients remain largely unclear, hindering the precise prediction of the effects of fire on soil biogeochemical cycles in a larger spatial scale.
Methods

We examined soil nutrient contents from restored grass slopes that had suffered wildfires and adjacent restored grass slopes without any wildfire. Topographic factors included slope aspects (north and south slopes) and positions (upper, middle and lower slopes).
Results

Fire significantly increased the contents of soil organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) (0–10 cm), ammonium (NH4+), and extractable phosphorous (EP), decreased the contents of nitrate (NO3−) and available potassium (AK), and had minimum influence on total phosphorus (TP) content. Slope aspect and position also affected soil nutrients, with higher contents in the north slope than the south slope and at the upper slope than the lower slope. The effects of fire on soil OC, TN, and NO3− were consistent across north and south slopes, but the effects on soil NH4+, TP, EP and AK varied with slope aspect. However, the effects of fire on soil nutrients were not influenced by slope position.
Conclusion

These results indicate that slope aspect should be considered in predicting the response of soil biogeochemical cycles to fire.},

Pre-treatment plant size was not important in determining post-fire plant survival, but it did influence the resprouting vigour, increasingly so with time. High temperatures induced higher mortality rates within populations, but duration of fire did not effect mortality. Biomass of resprouts was lower following more intense fire treatments, but this effect progressively disappeared over time, except in plants subjected to the most intense fire treatment. This is probably because of the increasing importance of the below-ground organs for the regeneration of the above-ground biomass. Some of the plants which were clipped but not exposed to fire also died 20 months after treatment. The effect of clipping on mortality and resprouting response, estimated as biomass of resprouts, was not significantly different from the effect induced by either low or medium temperature treatments, but was significantly different when compared with the effect of high-temperature treatments. Field observations show that the establishment of seedlings of E. multiflora is rare both after fire and between fires. Thus, our data support the idea that both a single fire or clipping can diminish the population size of a resprouting species. We conclude that fire may have a stochastic effect on E. multiflora populations, due to the variation in fire intensity existing within a single burning stand.},

  abstract = {The impact of a wildfire on some selected physicochemical, chemical (water retention, pH, electrical conductivity, free Fe and Al oxides, total C, extractable C), biochemical (microbial C, soil respiration, bacterial activity, βglucosidase, urease and phosphatase activities) and microbiological properties (analysis of phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA pattern) was evaluated in Fragas do Eume Natural Park (NW Spain). Soil samples were collected three months after the wildfire from the A horizon (0–2.5 and 2.55 cm) of the unburnt and burnt soil under climax vegetation (Quercus) and non-autochthonous vegetation (Eucalyptus). The results indicated that, independent of the vegetation considered, the wildfire induced short-term modifications of most soil properties analysed, more accentuated changes being those related to labile fractions of the soil organic matter (extractable C and microbial biomass C, negative effects) as well as those in pH and bacterial growth values (positive effects). The fire effect was often more noticeable in the 0–2.5 cm layer than in the 2.5–5 cm layer. The results of a principal component analysis performed with the matrix of the physicochemical and biochemical data showed that vegetation was the most important factor controlling the overall quality of these soils and that wildfire is also an important source of variation in soil quality. This is in agreement with the PLFA pattern, differentiating clearly the Quercus soil samples from the Eucalyptus ones and, to a lesser extent, the burnt soil samples from the corresponding unburnt ones. Medium- and long-term consequences of these microbial changes in the functioning of the plant–soil system should be investigated in order to preserve the biodiversity of the Natural Park.},

  abstract     = {Tribal communities in the Pacific Northwest of the United States of America (USA) have long-standing relationships to ancestral lands now managed by federal land management agencies. In recent decades, federal and state governments have increasingly recognized tribal rights to resources on public lands and to participate in their management. In support of a new planning initiative to promote sustainable land management, we reviewed scientific publications to examine relationships between tribal social-ecological systems and public lands in the region. We identified key ecocultural resources, impacts to those resources, and associated forest ecosystems, and strategies that have been piloted to redress those impacts. We found that many factors stemming from colonization by Euro-Americans have engendered social-ecological traps that have inhibited tribes from continuing traditional land stewardship activities that supported their well-being and maintained ecological integrity. These long-standing factors include legal and political constraints on tribal access and management; declining quality and abundance of forest resources due to inhibition of both natural disturbance and indigenous tending regimes; competition with nontribal users; species extirpations and introductions of invasive species; and erosion of tribal traditional ecological knowledge and relationships that are important for revitalizing resource use. As a consequence, both supply and demand for these forest resources have been reduced, as have the resilience and diversity of these ecosystems. Simply permitting resource harvest by tribal members does not sufficiently address the underlying constraints in ways that will promote tribal well-being. Escaping these traps will require addressing a gamut of ecological and social constraints through cooperative restoration efforts between land management agencies and tribes, several of which we highlight as examples. Because tribally focused restoration strategies generally align with broader strategies suggested to restore national forests in the region, they can foster both tribal well-being and ecological sustainability.},

  abstract     = {Fuel treatments aimed at reducing both horizontal and vertical continuity in fuels are of paramount importance as a prevention measure against fire propagation. Possible techniques include pruning, thinning (mainly low thinning), mastication, prescribed burning, and prescribed (or targeted) grazing. Their main target is crown fire avoidance by treating surface fuels and promoting low density and vertically discontinuous stands, thus eliminating fuel ladders. Grazing is an effective, nearly carbon-neutral weed control technique which is cost-effective, nontoxic, and nonpolluting. Goat grazing is a very interesting solution: if confined by a metallic or electrified fence within a restricted pen, with a rather high density, goats browse the available foliage and twigs from all woody plants as well as all herbaceous vegetation. They can feed on a variety of shrubs, some of which are useless for other domestic species, and are therefore the best adapted for the consumption of all the Mediterranean shrubs which represent the fuel ladder. The appropriate choice of season of grazing, type of plant species and type and amount of biomass to be eliminated, livestock density, social structure of the herd, grazing time per day, type of fencing, and size of pens define the prescribed grazing system.},

  abstract     = {In early 2003 a series of large, wildfire-related sediment slugs occurred in streams in the south-eastern Australian alpine region. Back-pack and boat-mounted electrofishing were used to measure changes in riverine fish fauna after one particularly large sediment slug which started in an upland stream and then travelled downstream through 200 km of third and fourth order stream. Twelve impact sites and eight control sites were surveyed where there were previous data on fish populations. The sites were surveyed directly after the sediment slug had passed and then 12, 24 and 36 months after. Immediately after the sediment slug, fish abundances fell by between 95–100\% at four impact sites in the upper reaches of the study area, primarily due to the effect of low-dissolved oxygen levels. Twelve months later fish numbers were still decreased in the upper catchment but showed signs of recovery after 24 months. Further downstream, where water quality was not as severely affected by the sediment slug, the effects on native fishes were less apparent. The circumstances of these events represented a unique opportunity to obtain baseline data regarding the effects of post-fire disturbances on fish, and their time to recovery. If fire were to occur in catchments where endangered species exist, our results suggest that actions such as translocation may be required to ensure the long-term survival of threatened species.},

In this study, global burned area estimates are used in conjunction with global gridded distributions of agricultural land-cover types (defined as the sum of cropland and pasture area) to separate the seasonality of agricultural burning practices from that of non-agricultural fire. The results presented in this study show that agricultural and non-agricultural land experience broadly different fire seasonality patterns that are not always linked to climate conditions. We highlight these differences on a regional basis, examining variations in both agricultural land cover and associated cultural practices to help explain our results. While we discuss two land-cover categories, the methods can be generalized to derive seasonality for any number of land uses or cover types. This will be useful as global fire models evolve to be fully interactive with land-use and land-cover change in the next generation of Earth system models.},

  abstract = {Most wildfire studies focus on the dramatic geomorphic and hydrological effects immediately after a wildfire; however, longer-term effects (5+ years) are also expected and can impact the seasonal availability of water, and annual and peak flows. These changes are especially relevant in regions that rely on water from forested areas. In this study, we present an analysis of (2005–2010) daily climate and streamflow data collected following the 2003 Lost Creek wildfire that burned the majority of the vegetated areas ({$>$}50\%) of two catchments in the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in southern Alberta, Canada. In the analysis, observed streamflow data showed 1.2 to 2.0 times higher mean annual water yield and 1.4 to 2.2 times higher mean peak flows from burned catchments compared to unburned catchments. The burned catchments did have distinct responses in seasonality, onset of peak and flow recession. Most notable was the recession, which was approximately 40\% faster in the burned catchments, compared to the unburned catchments. The differences observed between the burned and unburned catchment behaviors, especially in the annual yield and peak flow, were likely due to the combined impacts of wildfire and variability in climate (precipitation) over the catchments. We used the concept of elasticity commonly applied to climate change problems to account for precipitation variability. This approach suggested an increased annual flow in the burned catchments, but changes in peak flows were not detected. Overall the impact of just wildfire to streamflow was difficult to determine and surprisingly small during this timeframe when precipitation variability over the catchments were accounted for.},

Of particular concern are increases in water temperature during and following fires, but studies of these phenomena are uncommon. We examined effects of wildfires in 2000 on maximum water temperature for a suite of second- to fourth-order streams with a range of burn severities in the Bitterroot River basin, Montana. Despite many sites burning at high severity, there were no apparent increases in maximum water temperature during the fires. One month after fire and in the subsequent year, increases in maximum water temperatures at sites within burns were 1.4–2.28C greater than those at reference sites, with the greatest differences in July and August. Maximum temperature changes at sites 41.7 km downstream from burns did not differ from those at reference sites. Seven years after the fires, there was no evidence that maximum stream temperatures were returning to pre-fire norms. Temperature increases in these relatively large streams are likely to be long-lasting and exacerbated by climate change. These combined effects may alter the distribution of thermally sensitive aquatic species.},

  abstract = {Californian coastal sage scrub has floristically distinct subassociations with sharp boundaries in the Santa Monica Mountains. This mesoscale biogeographic pattern has been variously attributed to the timing and pattern of fire and to differences in the moisture availability on sites. An examination of the actual fire history of sites reveals that recent fire events are unlikely to have caused the observed patterns. Sites with similar fire histories are not as similar in vegetation as sites with different fire histories but similar aspect. Single short fire intervals do not result in dissimilar communities; fires are unlikely to recur with the same boundaries as these two subassociations. A simulation of shrub response to fire interval and intensity indicates that long-term fire trends are also unlikely to have caused the distinction or the sharp boundaries of the two subassociations. Both subassociations include species with life history characteristics adapted to short and to long fire intervals. The subassociations exist without regard to fire history.},

Eighteen experimental treatment combinations were tested. Three ages since last fire, three fire intensities, and two seasons were combined. Each treatment combination was repeated six times on plots of 50 × 50 cm. (2) All plant material was clipped, dried, and weighed. Q. coccifera was divided into hierarchical size-classes of basal and branch diameter. The plots were then burned using flame torches. The density and height of each Q. coccifera resprout was recorded through eight weeks following the burn treatments. (3) Significant differences in effect were found between plots of different ages, and between burns of different durations, but season is the dominant variable in all analyses: resprout density and growth are much greater following burning in late May than after burning in early October. Other than season, it is pre-fire canopy structure that most affects resprout vigour. Pre-fire stem density and woody and foliar biomass seem to be important variables, but definitive answers are precluded by high multicollinearity. (4) Path analyses support the hypothesis that resprout density is affected most by pre-fire stem density. This may indicate a reservoir of dormant meristematic tissue. Resprout growth is more strongly affected by pre-fire biomass value, indicative of underground carbohydrate reserves. More vigorous sprouting follows the spring burn, indicating either greater reserves following the flush of spring growth (compared with depleted condition following the dry season) or, more likely, the direct effect of warmer temperatures and increasing sunshine.},

  abstract     = {Pin˜on–juniper (PJ) fire regimes are generally characterised as infrequent high-severity. However, PJ ecosystems vary across a large geographic and bio-climatic range and little is known about one of the principal PJ functional types, PJ savannas. It is logical that (1) grass in PJ savannas could support frequent, low-severity fire and (2) exclusion of frequent fire could explain increased tree density in PJ savannas. To assess these hypotheses I used dendroecological methods to reconstruct fire history and forest structure in a PJ-dominated savanna. Evidence of highseverity fire was not observed. From 112 fire-scarred trees I reconstructed 87 fire years (1547–1899). Mean fire interval was 7.8 years for fires recorded at \$2 sites. Tree establishment was negatively correlated with fire frequency (r ¼ À0.74) and peak PJ establishment was synchronous with dry (unfavourable) conditions and a regime shift (decline) in fire frequency in the late 1800s. The collapse of the grass-fuelled, frequent, surface fire regime in this PJ savanna was likely the primary driver of current high tree density (mean ¼ 881 trees haÀ1) that is .600\% of the historical estimate. Variability in bio-climatic conditions likely drive variability in fire regimes across the wide range of PJ ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Anthropogenic alteration of ecosystem processes confounds forest management and conservation of rare, declining species. Restoration of forest structure and fire hazard reduction are central goals of forest management policy in the western United States, but restoration priorities and treatments have become increasingly contentious. Numerous studies have documented changes in fire regimes, forest stand structure and species composition following a century of fire exclusion in dry, frequent-fire forests of the western U.S. (e.g., ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer). In contrast, wet mixed-conifer forests are thought to have historically burned infrequently with mixed- or high-severity fire—resulting in reduced impacts from fire exclusion and low restoration need—but data are limited. In this study we quantified the current forest habitat of the federally endangered, terrestrial Jemez Mountains salamander (Plethodon neomexicanus) and compared it to dendroecological reconstructions of historical habitat (e.g., stand structure and composition), and fire regime parameters along a gradient from upper ponderosa pine to wet mixed-conifer forests. We found that current fire-free intervals in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat (116–165 years) are significantly longer than historical intervals, even in wet mixed-conifer forests. Historical mean fire intervals ranged from 10 to 42 years along the forest gradient. Low-severity fires were historically dominant across all forest types (92 of 102 fires). Although some mixed- or highseverity fire historically occurred at 67\% of the plots over the last four centuries, complete mortality within 1.0 ha plots was rare, and asynchronous within and among sites. Climate was an important driver of temporal variability in fire severity, such that mixed- and high-severity fires were associated with more extreme drought than low-severity fires. Tree density in dry conifer forests historically ranged from open (90 trees haÀ1) to moderately dense (400 trees haÀ1), but has doubled on average since fire exclusion. Infill of fire-sensitive tree species has contributed to the conversion of historically dry mixedconifer to wet mixed-conifer forest. We conclude that low-severity fire, which has been absent for over a century, was a critical ecosystem process across the forest gradient in Jemez Mountains salamander habitat, and thus is an important element of ecosystem restoration, resilience, and rare species recovery.

  abstract     = {Before widespread fire exclusion policies, American Indians used broadcast understory fires or cultural burns to enhance resources integral for their livelihood and cultural practices. To restore ecocultural resources depleted from decades of fire exclusion and to reduce wildfire risks, the Karuk and the Yurok Tribes of Northwest California are leading regional collaborative efforts to expand broadcast fires and fuel reduction treatments on public, private, and Tribal lands in their ancestral territories. Through collaboration with Karuk and Yurok Tribal members and basketweavers, we evaluated the effects of broadcast fires and three fire proxy treatments on California hazelnut shrubs (Corylus cornuta var. californica) that produce highly valued ecocultural resources for basketry materials. Across a 10 ha Douglas-fir and mixed hardwood forest (500 m a.s.l.) in the Klamath mountains, we established 27 stratified blocks (16 m2) and within each block applied three fire proxy treatments designed and used by Tribal members with an untreated control. These treatments involved manual hazelnut stem cutting, directly blistering hazelnut stems via propane torch, and igniting surface fuels piled within hazelnut shrubs to top-kill stems. Broadcast fire was applied to 12 separate blocks. After a full growing season (12–18 months post-treatment/burn), shrubs were re-measured. We then harvested these stems (n = 604; 50 shrubs) across treatments and compared results with stems gathered independently by two experienced Karuk/ Yurok basketweavers (n = 396 and n = 73) from an adjacent broadcast burned site. Compared to the untreated shrubs, pile burning, propane torching, and broadcast burning increased basketry stem production by 7–10 fold (p {$<$} 0.001), while the cutting treatment increased production by 4-fold (p = 0.006). Shrubs with relatively greater access to sunlight (southern aspect, ≥51\% and {$<$} 70\% canopy cover) produced fewer quality stems when compared to shrubs with an eastern aspect (p {$<$} 0.01) and ≥70\% canopy cover (p {$<$} 0.05). Harvested stems across all treatments displayed similar stem length distributions to those gathered by one of the two basketweavers (p {$>$} 0.05). Our results demonstrate that these fire-proxy methods are an effective means to increase the production and quality of basketry materials. Expanding the area and frequency of targeted understory fire-based forest treatments on private, public and Tribal lands in California and the Pacific Northwest would substantially increase the availability of these fire-enhanced ecocultural resources that are currently limited in supply and in high demand.},

The reconstructions are compared with the two potential controls of burning at these broad scales e changes in climate and human activities e to assess their relative importance on trends in biomass burning. Here we consider several hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the Holocene record of fire, including climate, human activities and synergies between the two. Our results suggest that 1) episodes of high fire activity were relatively common in the early Holocene and were consistent with climate changes despite low global temperatures and low levels of biomass burning globally; 2) there is little evidence from the paleofire record to support the Early Anthropocene Hypothesis of human modification of the global carbon cycle; 3) there was a nearly-global increase in fire activity from 3 to 2 ka that is difficult to explain with either climate or humans, but the widespread and synchronous nature of the increase suggests at least a partial climate forcing; and 4) burning during the past century generally decreased but was spatially variable; it declined sharply in many areas, but there were also large increases (e.g., Australia and parts of Europe). Our analysis does not exclude an important role for human activities on global biomass burning during the Holocene, but instead provides evidence for a pervasive influence of climate across multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract     = {Fire can affect soil properties depending on a number of factors including fire severity and soil type. Aggregate stability (AS) refers to soil structure resilience in response to external mechanical forces. Many authors consider soil aggregation to be a parameter reflecting soil health, as it depends on chemical, physical and biological factors. The response of AS to forest fires is complex, since it depends on how fire has affected other related properties such as organic matter content, soil microbiology, water repellency and soil mineralogy. Opinions differ concerning the effect of fire on AS. Some authors have observed a decrease in AS in soils affected by intense wildfire or severe laboratory heating. However, others have reported increases. We provide an up to date review of the research on this topic and an analysis of the causes for the different effects observed. The implications for soil system functioning and for the hydrology of the affected areas are also discussed. Generally, low severity fires do not produce notable changes in AS, although in some cases an increase has been observed and attributed to increased water repellency. In contrast, high severity fires can induce important changes in this property, but with different effects depending on the type of soil affected. The patterns observed can vary from a disaggregation as a consequence of the organic matter destruction, to a strong aggregation if a recrystallization of some minerals such as Fe and Al oxyhydroxides occurs when they are present in sufficient quantities in the soil, after exposure to high temperatures. Because of the complexity of the different possible effects and reasons for the potential changes in the fire-affected soil aggregates, the inclusion of other parameters in the studies is necessary to understand the results. The suggested parameters to include in the examination of AS are: soil organic matter, microbial biomass, water repellency, texture, aggregate size distribution, together with accurate ways of estimating fire severity. More research is needed on what implications there are for soil system functioning with the changes suffered by aggregates after fire. Studies including measurements at very different scales: from AS measurements in the laboratory to erosion rates measured at pedon, slope and catchment scales are also necessary.},

  abstract = {In ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of the western United States, prescribed burns are used to reduce fuel loads and restore historical fire regimes. The season of and interval between burns can have complex consequences for the ecosystem, including the production of pyrogenic carbon (PyC). PyC plays a crucial role in soil carbon cycling, displaying turnover times that are orders of magnitude longer than unburned organic matter. This work investigated how the season of and interval between prescribed burns affects soil organic matter, including the formation and retention of PyC, in a ponderosa pine forest of eastern Oregon. In 1997 a prescribed burn study was implemented in Malheur National Forest to examine the ecological effects of burning at 5 and 15year intervals in either the spring or fall. In October 2015, both O-horizon and mineral soil (0–15 cm) samples were collected and analyzed for PyC concentration, content, and structure using the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method. O-horizon depth, carbon and nitrogen concentration and content, pH, and bulk density were also measured. Plots burned in the spring and fall had lower C and N stocks in the O-horizon compared to the unburned controls due to a reduction in O-horizon depth; however, we did not observe any differences in Ohorizon concentration of C or N. Moreover, the concentrations and stocks of C and N in the mineral soil of plots burned in the spring or fall were the same as or only very slightly different from the unburned controls, suggesting that the prescribed burns on these sites have not adversely affected SOM quantity in the surface mineral soil carbon pools over the course of this 18-year experiment. Compared to unburned controls, we estimate that fall burns increased the mean PyC concentration of the mineral soil by 8.42 g BPCA/kg C. We did not detect a difference in mean PyC concentration of the mineral soil between the spring burns and the unburned controls; however, the spring burn plots did contain a number of isolated pockets with very high concentrations of PyC, suggesting a patchier burn pattern for these plots. In general, there was no detectable difference in any of the response variables when comparing the various prescribed burn treatments to one another. Reestablishing fire in these forests resulted in minor effects on the PyC concentration and pH, which may have beneficial impacts on soil carbon and available nutrients, while having few effects on other soil characteristics. This suggests that the application of low severity prescribed fires should result in little detrimental change to soils of ponderosa pine forests of the Southern Blue Mountains, while achieving management objectives such as reduction of surface fuels.},

As knowledge about the physiological and behavioural adaptations that are crucial for post-wildfire survival is scant, we investigated the thermal biology of a small insectivorous marsupial (Antechinus flavipes) after a severe forest fire. Some populations of antechinus survived the fire in situ probably by hiding deep in rocky crevices, the only fire-proof sites near where they were trapped. We hypothesised that survival in the post-fire landscape was achieved by decreasing daytime activity and using torpor frequently to save energy. Indeed, daytime activity was less common and torpor expression was substantially higher (≥2-fold) at the post-fire site than observed in an unburnt control site and also in comparison to a laboratory study, both when food was provided ad libitum and withheld. Basking in the post-fire site was also recorded, which was likely used to further reduce energy expenditure. Our data suggest that torpor and basking are used by this terrestrial mammal to reduce energy and foraging requirements, which is important in a landscape where food and shelter are limited and predation pressure typically is increased.},

  abstract     = {An understanding of what variables affect the ignition of live wildland fuels is crucial to predicting crown fire spread, the most poorly understood type of wildland fire. Ignition tests were performed over the course of an entire year for ten species (three species in year one, seven in year two) to evaluate seasonal changes in flammability. Ignition delay and mass loss rate at ignition were measured for a radiant heat flux of 50 kW/m2 and flow velocity of 1 m/s. Large species-to-species variation occurred in two-variable linear correlations between moisture content, ignition time, and mass loss rate at ignition. Only a few species showed the same behavior as wet wood. Due to potential physical and chemical changes that live fuels undergo during the growing season, moisture content is not a particularly useful descriptor of ignition behavior for live fuels.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying the role of black carbon (BC) in geochemical processes is difficult due to the heterogeneous character of its chemical structure. Chestnut wood charcoal samples produced at heat treatment temperatures (HTT) from 200–1000 °C were analysed using two different solid state 13C NMR techniques. First, aromaticity was determined as the percentage of total signal present in the aromatic region of 13C direct polarisation (DP) spectra. This was found to increase through the low temperature range of 200–400 °C; at higher temperatures, aromaticity was found to be {$>$}90\%. Second, aromatic condensation was determined through the measurement of the chemical shift of 13Cbenzene sorbed to the charcoals, which is influenced by the presence of ‘‘ring currents’’ in the aromatic domains of the charcoals. This technique was less sensitive to molecular changes through the lower temperature range, but showed there was a smooth increase in the degree of condensation of the aromatic structures with increasing temperature through the temperature range 400–1000 °C. Ab initio molecular modelling was used to estimate the size of aromatic domains in the charcoals based on the strength of the ring currents detected. These calculations indicated that charcoals produced at temperatures below 500 °C contain aromatic domains no larger than coronene (7 ring). At higher temperatures the size of these domains rapidly increases, with structures larger than a 19 ring symmetrical PAH being predominant in charcoals produced at temperatures above 700 °C. Data from this study were found to be generally consistent with previously published measurements using the benzenepolycarboxylic acid (BPCA) molecular marker method on the same set of samples.},

  abstract     = {Burning crop residue before and/or after harvest is a common farming practice however; there is no baseline estimate for cropland burned area in the contiguous U.S. (CONUS). We present the results of a study, using five years of remotely sensed satellite data to map the location and areal extent of crop residue burning in the CONUS. Our burned area approach combines 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) data, with 1 km MODIS active fire counts calibrated using coincident high resolution satellite data to generate area estimates. Our results show that cropland burning is an extensive and recurring annual event in several states in the CONUS. On average, 1,239,000 ha of croplands burn annually, which is equivalent to 43\% of the annual average area of wildland fires in the U.S., as reported by the United States Forest Service for the same period. Several states experience high levels (N 30,000 ha yr−1) of crop residue burning, including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, and Washington. Validation with high resolution burn scar imagery and GPS data collected during targeted field campaigns showed a moderate to high-level accuracy for our burned area estimates, ranging from 78 to 90\%. Our approach provides a more consistent methodology for quantifying cropland burned area at regional scales than the previously available U.S. national and state-level statistics on crop residue burning.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed fire has been used in a coordinated manner to manage fuels in eucalypt forests of southern Australia since the 1950s. The impetus for planned use of fire arose from the need to reduce the impact of extensive, high intensity fires on life, property and commercial forest values. Prescribed fire is increasingly recognised as also playing an important role in mitigating undesirable effects of high intensity fires on environmental values including soil, water and biodiversity. Critical elements for an effective prescribed fire program include a sound understanding of fire behaviour, an experienced and flexible workforce, and organisational commitment to adaptive management involving planning, monitoring and applied research. Implementation of prescribed fire programs has been closely linked with, and dependent upon, the development of burning guides for particular forest types through empirical field research. The contribution of prescribed fire to mitigating the effects of extensive, high intensity fires can be quantified in a variety of ways using basic combustion science, well-documented case studies, analysis of fire statistics, and simulation. Fuel reduction can improve the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of fire suppression, although these effects may be subtle and difficult to measure. Social and political factors can significantly influence the conduct and effectiveness of prescribed fire programs, and effective engagement with the community during planning, implementation and post-fire monitoring phases is essential to ensure that the role of prescribed fire in land management is properly recognised and understood.},

  abstract     = {Foliar live fuel moisture (LFM)—the weight of water in living plant foliage expressed as a percentage of dry weight—typically affects fire behavior in live wildland fuels. In juniper communities, juniper LFM is important for planning prescribed burns and wildfire response but can be time consuming to obtain regularly. Also, there has been little analysis of the ways in which juniper LFM varies seasonally or is affected by weather conditions, soil moisture, or other variables such as drought index. Using an eight-year dataset of Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei J. Buchholz) LFM observations from four sites in central Texas, USA, we found that the interannual variability of Ashe juniper LFM differs among seasons. Throughout the eight-year sample period, winter LFM fluctuated within a narrow range between about 80\% and 120\% and was weakly related to Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI). During summer, LFM fluctuated widely and was more strongly related to KBDI. KBDI below 315 was positively related to LFM, while KBDI above 526 was strongly negatively related to LFM. For this region, we offer a KBDI of about 500 as a threshold for fire planning, above which the potential for critically low Ashe juniper LFM becomes more likely.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} A short, but severe, wildfire smoke episode in July 2015, with an aerosol
optical depth (AOD) approaching 9, is shown to strongly impact radiation
budgets across four distinct land-use types (forest, field, urban and
wetland). At three of the sites, impacts on the energy balance are also
apparent, while the event also appears to elicit an ecosystem response with
respect to carbon fluxes at the wetland and a forested site. Greatest impacts on
radiation and energy budgets were observed at the forested site where the
role of canopy architecture and the complex physiological responses to an
increase in diffuse radiation were most important. At the forest site, the
arrival of smoke reduced both sensible and latent heat flux substantially
but also lowered sensible heat flux more than the latent heat flux. With
widespread standing water, and little physiological control on
evapotranspiration, the impacts on the partitioning of turbulent
fluxes were modest at the wetland compared to the physiologically dominated
fluxes at the forested site. Despite the short duration and singular nature
of the event, there was some evidence of a diffuse radiation fertilization
effect when AOD was near or below~2. With lighter smoke, both the wetland
and forested site appeared to show enhanced photosynthetic activity (a
greater sink for carbon dioxide). However, with dense smoke, the forested site
was a strong carbon source. Given the extensive forest cover in the Pacific
Northwest and the growing importance of forest fires in the region, these
results suggest that wildfire aerosol during the growing season potentially
plays an important role in the regional ecosystem response to smoke and
ultimately the carbon budget of the region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Patch-burn grazing (PBG) was tested as an alternative management technique that is ecologically similar to historically heterogeneous fire and grazing regimes and holds promise as a rangeland management tool that may benefit grassland wildlife. We conducted a 3-year study to compare nest-site selection and nest survival of greater prairie-chickens, an umbrella species for tallgrass prairie conservation, on private lands managed with PBG or intensive fire and grazing in the Flint Hills of Kansas. The goal of our field study was to evaluate the relationships among rangeland management practices, habitat conditions, and nesting ecology of greater prairie-chickens. Nest-site selection and nest survival of prairie-chickens were both directly related to vertical nesting cover, which was determined by the fire return interval of a pasture. Nesting habitat was affected little by stocking rate in PBG management regimes because preferred nest sites were unburned patches that were not grazed by cattle. Overall, the quantity and quality of nesting sites was improved under PBG management when compared with more intensive rangeland management regimes. Our results join a growing body of evidence that rangeland management strategies that mimic historical heterogeneous fire and grazing regimes benefit native species of prairie wildlife.},

  abstract     = {In most parts of the world where people have colonized and modified their landscapes for several millennia or more, it is often difficult to discriminate anthropogenic burning from natural fire regimes that are linked to climate regimes. New Zealand provides a unique setting for identifying human influence on fire occurrence because it was settled recently (c. AD 1280) at a time when climates are considered to be similar to today. Late-Holocene pollen and charcoal records from New Zealand provide striking evidence for initial Polynesian (Māori) arrival being strongly associated with widespread burning and loss of native forest. The duration of initial forest clearance and the spatial pattern of burning that led to this transformation are still poorly understood. We present high-resolution charcoal and pollen analyses of sediment cores from five lakes, located on the deforested eastern side of the Southern Alps. These records document the local fire history of the last 1000 years and the response of vegetation and watersheds to burning. Our results suggest that one to several high-severity fires occurred within a few decades of initial Māori arrival, and this ‘Initial Burning Period’ (IBP) resulted in the majority of forest loss and erosion. Changes in sedimentation rates, soil chemistry and magnetic susceptibility occurred simultaneously with the first fires at some sites, and marked the end of the IBP at others, suggesting substantial and rapid alteration of watershed vegetation, soil and biochemistry. Timing of the beginning of the IBP varied across sites but the duration of this period was brief (decades to a century). Our results suggest that Māori burning of native forests was deliberate and systematic. These forests had no previous history of fire and thus showed little resilience to the introduction of a new disturbance.},

  abstract     = {Several wildfire prevention programs in Spain are using grazing livestock to maintain fuelbreaks with low levels of biomass. Even though shepherds are remunerated for these services, many of their farms are hardly viable in the current socio-economic context. By analyzing 54 small ruminant farms participating in the Grazed Fuelbreak Network in Andalusia (southern Spain), this research aimed to identify the main types and characteristics of such farms and, considering the challenges they are facing, propose strategies to improve both their economic viability and their effectiveness in fuelbreak grazing. Based on data collected through a survey on key farm management aspects, a multivariate analysis was performed and four main types of farm were identified: two clusters of dairy goat farms and two composed mostly of meat-purpose sheep farms. Farms in all clusters could benefit from improvements in the feeding and reproductive management of livestock, either to enhance their productivity or to make better use of the pasture resources available. Dairy goat farms remain more dependent on external animal feed to ensure a better lactation, therefore they should either diminish their workforce costs per animal or sell transformed products directly to consumers to improve their economic viability. Best fuelbreak grazing results were related to larger flocks combining sheep and goats, lower ratios of fuelbreak surface area per animal, and longer (year-long) grazing periods on fuelbreaks. Therefore, such farm features and adjusted fuelbreak assignments should be favored in wildfire prevention programs using grazing services.},

  abstract     = {The forest-steppe ecotone of the eastern slope of the Andes in Central Western Patagonia (43◦40′–49◦15′ S, Chile, South America) provides a unique area for assessing long and short term dynamics between humans and past environments. Central Western Patagonia was a demographically marginal zone inhabited intermittently and with low intensity by hunter-gatherers during the Holocene. This paper adopts a novel approach in order to assess the relationship between trends in the archeological, pollen, and charcoal records. The recognition of temporal and spatial scales in both archeology and paleoecology is crucial for defining roles in paleofire records. The main goal of the paper is to assess the role of climate and human beings as potential ignitors of wildfires by acknowledging the scales in which they operate and the different roles either one played in paleofire trends. We investigated a case study in the Cisnes River Valley (CRV) where the frequencies and magnitudes of fire episodes—reconstructed from macro-charcoal particles from the Lake Shaman intermoraine sequence—can be attributed to human action, while acknowledging the driving role of climate over broader time scales. The Lake Shaman charcoal record spanning the last 19,000 cal years is compared to the archeological record starting at 11,500 cal years BP. After comparing paleofires, reconstructed from the charcoal record, with peaks and troughs in the radiocarbon record and archeological evidence at local and site scales, we argue that this approach provides insights for assessing the timing and magnitude of human effects on the environment. We examine collation and correlation scenarios for comparative trends between the archeological, pollen, and charcoal records. The correlation of occupational events at the El Chueco 1 archeological site and other sites along the CRV with the results obtained at Lake Shaman is suggestive of a combination of human agency and climate drivers in the occurrence of fires during most of the Holocene.},

  abstract     = {Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) (ERC) is a conifer native to North America that has been used for a variety of wood products, and its planting has been encouraged to help stabilize soil, reforest abandoned farmland, and provide cover for wildlife. However, ERC tends to expand rapidly and take over certain areas primarily because it can grow on a wide variety of soils and tolerates salt and harsh climatic conditions. As a result of this invasive behavior, the ERC composition of central United States forestlands has been on the rise over several decades. To evaluate the current status and recent trends of ERC on forestland in eight central states, we analyzed forest resource data collected annually from 2001 to 2012 by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service at county, state, and regional levels. Our results indicate that ERC increased in terms of area, density, and volume across a range of diameter classes. In addition, ERC seedling abundance increased, and we found a statistically significant relationship between decreasing tree species diversity and ERC basal area proportion. We draw several conclusions from these analyses: (1) the geographic distribution of ERC in central US forestlands is widespread, but varies in density, (2) the area of ERC forestland increased most significantly in Nebraska and Missouri during the early 2000s, (3) the density and volume of ERC are on the rise in the region, and (4) the changes in seedling species abundance and the negative association between diversity and ERC presence suggest that the future composition of forests in the region could be altered if the current trends in ERC invasion continue.},

Heat effects on air seed cavitation were quantified using air injection experiments that isolate potential temperature-dependent changes in sap surface tension and pit membrane pore diameters. Heat effects on conduit wall structure were demonstrated using air conductivity measurements and light microscopy. • Heating increased vulnerability to cavitation because sap surface tension varies inversely with temperature. Heating did not affect cavitation via changes in pit membrane pore diameters, but did cause significant reductions in xylem air conductivity that were associated with deformation of conduit walls (probably resulting from thermal softening of viscoelastic cell wall polymers). • Additional work is required to understand the relative roles of cavitation and deformation in the reduction of xylem conductivity, and how reduced xylem conductivity in roots, stems, and branches correlates and interacts with foliage and root necroses to cause tree mortality. Future research should also examine how heat necrosis of ray parenchyma cells affects refilling of embolisms that occur during and after the fire event.},

One possibility is that fire causes direct, or indirect, fatal damage to plant hydraulic systems. If true, this suggests that burned plants ultimately die of drought. This hypothesis was tested on the post-fire response of a “fire-resister” species of the Cape Proteaceae, as well as by analysing its morphology. Fire-resisters are plants which are incapable of resprouting, but nevertheless survive some fires. Mortality of the studied fire-resister appears to be compatible with a hydraulic death hypothesis because i) most post-fire mortality occurred within days, ii) it occurred from the base-upwards and iii) correlated negatively with stem diameter rather than plant height. Higher levels of survival of the fire-resister is probably due to absolutely thicker bark than co-occurring re-seeder species of the same age. Since this bark has not evolved to protect buds, it has probably evolved to protect stem hydraulic systems.},

  abstract = {The trophic ecology of 11 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa found in Cache Creek, Yellowstone National Park (YNP) was studied to determine if burned organic matter is an important resource and how resource utilization patterns may be altered in post—fire streams. Laboratory food quality experiments were conducted to determine the growth response of each species when grown on several resource types: burned organic matter, periphyton, unburned coarse particulate material (CPM), and unburned fine particulate material (FPM). The central hypothesis of this research was that benthic macroinvertebrates cannot use burned organic matter as a resource. A secondary hypothesis was that some benthic macroinvertebrates are facultative in trophic function, with the ability to use both allochthonous and autochthonous resources for growth. Of the 11 taxa studied, only one (Paraleptophlebia heteronea) could grow on burned organic matter as a resource, indicating that post—fire food webs probably do not exhibit major shifts in resource utilization to burned material. Two species were generalist detrivores (P. heteronea, Ameletus cooki) able to use both natural FPM and CPM resources. Two species were specialist detritivores (Oligophlebodes sigma, Ephemerella infrequens) growing only on unburned CPM resources, and two (Cinygmula mimus, Epeorus albertae) were specialist herbivores utilizing only periphyton. Five species were generalist herbivore—detritivores (Baetis bicaudatus, Drunella doddsi, D. coloradensis, D. spinifera, Zapada columbiana), exhibiting growth on both detritus and periphyton resources. Based on the experimental results, trophic generalists are common food web components in Yellowstone streams. Two of the most abundant benthic macroinvertebrates during post—fire recovery, B. bicaudatus and Z. columbiana, were trophic generalists, indicating that some generalists may be disturbance adapted. In this study, published functional feeding group classification did not indicate obligate resource utilization (growth on only one resource type) for most taxa studied. Comparison of a food web for Cache Creek based on functional feeding group classification and one based on the results of this study indicates that the inclusion of generalists in the web results in a more realistic approximation of food web relationships such as the link—species scaling law. Our results suggest that future research should include spatial and temporal aspects of resource switching and generalist resource utilization by individual lotic primary consumers.},

However, these fires have been associated with more severe consequences than those from other causes. This paper examines whether fires caused by faults in electricity distribution infrastructure occur more often during periods of elevated fire danger, thereby increasing their consequence. The occurrence of wildfires caused by electricity distribution infrastructure were compared to those attributed to other causes during periods of elevated fire danger across the State of Victoria, Australia, where historically such fires have had significant impact on lives and assets of value. The results provided strong evidence that fires caused by electrical faults are more prevalent during elevated fire danger conditions and that they burn larger areas than fires ignited by most other causes. As a result the consequences of fires caused by electricity infrastructure are worse than fires from other causes. This knowledge highlights the importance of mitigating ignition-causing faults in the electricity network, particularly on days of elevated fire danger.},

  abstract = {In spite of suppression efforts, severe wildfires burn large areas of southern California grassland, coastal sage scrub, and chaparr.al. Such large burns may not have been characteristic prior to the initiation of lire suppression more than 70 years ago. To compare controlled with uncontrolled areas, wildfires of southern California and adjacent northern Baja California were evaluated for the period 1972 to 1980 from Landsat imagery. Fire size and location, vegetation, year, and season were recorded. It was found that suppression has divergent effects on different plant communities depending on successional processes, growth rates, fuel accumulation, decomposition rates, and length of flammability cycles. These variables establish feedback between the course of active fires, fire history, spatial configuration di flammable vegetation, and fire size. Suppression has minimal impact in coastal sage scrub and grassland. Fire control in chaparral reduces the number of fires, not burned hectara\textasciitilde e; fires consequently increase in size, spread rate, and intensity and become uncontrollable in severe weather conditions. The Baja California chaparral fire regime may serve as a model for prescribed burning in southern California.},

  abstract     = {The effects of wildfire on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of streams in mixed-conifer forest were examined for 10 successive years following the Mortar Creek Fire of 1979. Changes in burned-catchment streams were evaluated relative to a paired set of reference-catchment streams. Taxa richness and total abundance tended to be lower in burn than in reference streams but to converge near the end of the study; increases in the final years in both burn and reference streams were associated with reduced flows due to drought. Total biomass and that of the scraper, filterer, and miner functional groups usually were greater in the burn streams. Lack of a strong relationship of macroinvertebrate metrics with weather conditions showed that factors specific to each stream also were influencing the biotic community. Mean among-year Jaccard similarity was lower for burn than for reference streams. Specific taxa responded differently to the effects of fire. Densities of disturbance-adapted forms (e.g. Chironomidae, Baetis) increased after the fire but not during the drought period of more stable flows at the end of the study; many other taxa showed the opposite response. Adverse effects of wildfire on the biotic community were largely the result of physical changes in habitat due to increased runoff. Timing and magnitude of effects differed widely among streams as a result of differences in stream size, burn severity, and specific storm or snow-melt events. Though major effects of the fire on the macroinvertebrates dissipated within 7 years, adjustment in the habitat and biotic conditions still were taking place at the end of 10 year and normal recovery patterns may have been obscured by the drought.},

Direct effects of fire generally are minor or indiscernible. Indirect effects, resulting primarily from increased rates of runoff and channel alteration, have the greatest impacts on macroinvertebrate community metrics and foodweb responses. Postfire effects are variable in time and space, but in smaller size streams (first to fourth order) that are otherwise undisturbed, changes generally are restricted to the first 5–10 years following fire and are associated with the more intense burns (crown fires with  50\% of the catchment involved). In unfragmented habitats, initially supporting intact, functioning stream ecosystems, recovery from fire appears to be relatively rapid and to contribute to enhanced aquatic productivity and biodiversity. However, in poorly managed watersheds and those subjected to indiscriminate salvage logging, impacts from fire are expected to be greater and recovery of the macroinvertebrate communities and stream ecosystems more protracted.},

  abstract     = {Catastrophic wildland fires have resulted under extreme wind conditions due to power line system failures. Under conditions of ‘‘extreme fire weather’’, multiple ignitions due to power lines over a broad geographic area can occur under conditions promoting explosive fire growth. Such instances have been observed in the US state of California in 2007, and several times in recent Australian history – most notably the lethal Black Saturday fires of 2009. Ignitions can occur from a variety of failure modes in the huge array of components making up distribution and transmission networks and their neighboring environment. These failures fall into two general categories however: elastic extension of either the conductors or surrounding objects (such as tree limbs) causing electrical contact and arcing, and fatigue failures under high strain conditions affecting system components (conductors, poles, crossarms) or surrounding objects (trees). Both failure classes show a strong dependence on increasing wind speed. Case studies will be shown demonstrating both of these categories. Greatly compounding these physical wind dependencies is the expectation that failure probability will increase sharply with wind speed in an extreme value statistical dependency, such as a reverse Weibull distribution. Outage data from electric distribution systems is shown to demonstrate a very strong increase with wind speed –suggesting that outage data from normal operation of an electrical grid may be used to gauge system vulnerability to extreme fire weather conditions. These results also underline the importance of having appropriate design requirements and contingency plans to account for reasonably foreseeable catastrophic weather conditions. Mitigation measures being discussed or implemented by regulators and utilities are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Fire is a dominant, and well-studied, structuring force in many temperate and semi-arid communities; yet, few studies have investigated the effects of fire on multi-trophic interactions. Here, we ask how fire-induced changes in flowering affect the abundance of bumble bee foragers (Bombus vosnesenskii) and whether differences in floral resource availability are due to changes in plant species composition or lengthened bloom of a consistent set of species within burned and unburned grasslands. Following fire, burned and unburned sites had similar early spring bee and floral abundances. However, after the early bloom, forager activity remained high only in burned sites, where floral abundance persisted for longer. Importantly, the increased floral abundance following fire was due to a lengthening of within-species flowering phenology, as burned areas later in the season retained floral abundance and composition similar to that of unburned areas early in the season. Furthermore, density of flower patches chosen by bumble bee foragers was significantly higher at burned sites, suggesting an increase in patch quality for foragers in post-fire communities. Our results suggest positive effects of fire for bumble bee foragers and forb communities in California grassland ecosystems in the year following disturbance, namely through differences in plant phenology and floral density. We conclude that fire-induced changes in flowering phenology can alter interspecific interactions and benefit pollinators.},

  abstract     = {Research into post-wildfire effects began in the United States more than 70 years ago and only later extended to other parts of the world. Post-wildfire responses are typically transient, episodic, variable in space and time, dependent on thresholds, and involve multiple processes measured by different methods. These characteristics tend to hinder research progress, but the large empirical knowledge base amassed in different regions of the world suggests that it should now be possible to synthesize the data and make a substantial improvement in the understanding of post-wildfire runoff and erosion response. Thus, it is important to identify and prioritize the research issues related to post-wildfire runoff and erosion. Priority research issues are the need to: (1) organize and synthesize similarities and differences in post-wildfire responses between different fire-prone regions of the world in order to determine common patterns and generalities that can explain cause and effect relations; (2) identify and quantify functional relations between metrics of fire effects and soil hydraulic properties that will better represent the dynamic and transient conditions after a wildfire; (3) determine the interaction between burned landscapes and temporally and spatially variable meso-scale precipitation, which is often the primary driver of post-wildfire runoff and erosion responses; (4) determine functional relations between precipitation, basin morphology, runoff connectivity, contributing area, surface roughness, depression storage, and soil characteristics required to predict the timing, magnitudes, and duration of floods and debris flows from ungaged burned basins; and (5) develop standard measurement methods that will ensure the collection of uniform and comparable runoff and erosion data. Resolution of these issues will help to improve conceptual and computer models of post-wildfire runoff and erosion processes.},

  abstract     = {The complex interactions between the inclined terrain and the flow generated by the fire make the slope one of the most influencing factors on fire spread. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in wildfires spreading upslope, the investigation of flow dynamics and heat transfers is fundamental. This paper reports a series of fire spread experiments conducted across a porous bed of excelsior in a large-scale facility, under both no-slope and 30° up-slope conditions. The coupling of particle image velocimetry and video imaging allowed characterizing the flow pattern with respect to the fire front. Simultaneous heat flux measurements with high scan rate were also performed at the edge of the fuel bed. From the collected data, the increase of the rate of spread with increasing slope is attributed to a major change in fluid dynamics surrounding the flame. For horizontal fire spread, flame fronts exhibit quasi-vertical plume resulting from the buoyancy forces generated by the fire. These buoyancy effects induce an inward flow of ambient air that is entrained laterally into the fire from both sides. Flame radiation is the dominant fuel preheating mechanism. Under upslope conditions, the fire plume is tilted toward the unburnt vegetation, increasing radiation levels. The air entrainment at the burnt side of the fire strongly influences the downstream flow, which becomes attached to the surface over a characteristic length scale. Ahead of the flame front, the induced wind blows away from the fire rather than toward it, enhancing convective heating. Periodical forward bursts of flame combined with distant fuel ignitions were also observed. The heat flux measurements confirmed the existence of such convective mechanisms. © 2017 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Fire-driven deforestation is the major source of carbon emissions from Amazonia. Recent expansion of mechanized agriculture in forested regions of Amazonia has increased the average size of deforested areas, but related changes in fire dynamics remain poorly characterized. We estimated the contribution of fires from the deforestation process to total fire activity based on the local frequency of active fire detections from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. High-confidence fire detections at the same ground location on 2 or more days per year are most common in areas of active deforestation, where trunks, branches, and stumps can be piled and burned many times before woody fuels are depleted. Across Amazonia, high-frequency fires typical of deforestation accounted for more than 40\% of the MODIS fire detections during 2003–2007. Active deforestation frontiers in Bolivia and the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso, Para´, and Rondoˆ nia contributed 84\% of these high-frequency fires during this period. Among deforested areas, the frequency and timing of fire activity vary according to postclearing land use. Fire usage for expansion of mechanized crop production in Mato Grosso is more intense and more evenly distributed throughout the dry season than forest clearing for cattle ranching (4.6 vs. 1.7 fire days per deforested area, respectively), even for clearings 4200 ha in size. Fires for deforestation may continue for several years, increasing the combustion completeness of cropland deforestation to nearly 100\% and pasture deforestation to 50–90\% over 1–3-year timescales typical of forest conversion. Our results demonstrate that there is no uniform relation between satellite-based fire detections and carbon emissions. Improved understanding of deforestation carbon losses in Amazonia will require models that capture interannual variation in the deforested area that contributes to fire activity and variable combustion completeness of individual clearings as a function of fire frequency or other evidence of postclearing land use.},

  abstract     = {Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low ({$<$}0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to {$<$}0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.},

  abstract     = {Summary Ecological disturbances are often hypothesized to alter community assembly processes that influence variation in community composition (?-diversity). Disturbance can cause convergence in community composition (low ?-diversity) by increasing niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Alternatively, disturbance can cause divergence in community composition (high ?-diversity) by increasing habitat filtering across environmental gradients. However, because disturbance may also influence ?-diversity through random sampling effects owing to changes in the number of individuals in local communities (community size) or abundances in the regional species pool, observed patterns of ?-diversity alone cannot be used to unambiguously discern the relative importance of community assembly mechanisms. We compared ?-diversity of woody plants and inferred assembly mechanisms among unburned forests and forests managed with prescribed fires in the Missouri Ozarks, USA. Using a null-model approach, we compared how environmental gradients influenced ?-diversity after controlling for differences in local community size and regional species abundances between unburned and burned landscapes. Observed ?-diversity was higher in burned landscapes. However, this pattern disappeared or reversed after controlling for smaller community size in burned landscapes. ?-diversity was higher than expected by chance in both landscapes, indicating an important role for processes that create clumped species distributions. Moreover, fire appeared to decrease clumping of species at broader spatial scales, suggesting homogenization of community composition through niche selection of disturbance-tolerant species. Environmental variables, however, explained similar amounts of variation in ?-diversity in both landscapes, suggesting that disturbance did not alter the relative importance of habitat filtering. Our results indicate that contingent responses of communities to fire reflect a combination of fire-induced changes in local community size and scale-dependent effects of fire on species clumping across landscapes. Synthesis. Although niche-based mechanisms of community assembly are often invoked to explain changes in community composition following disturbance, our results suggest that these changes also arise through random sampling effects owing to the influence of disturbance on community size. Comparative studies of these processes across disturbed ecosystems will provide important insights into the ecological conditions that determine when disturbance alters the interplay of deterministic and stochastic processes in natural and human-modified landscapes.},

  abstract     = {The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84\% the first year after fire to 73\% and 25\%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.},

  abstract     = {1 Although serotiny is frequently considered to have evolved under the selective pressure of fires, the drying conditions that induce cone opening are not necessarily associated with fire. We hypothesized that in Pinus halepensis, a Mediterranean serotinous wind-dispersed tree, xeriscence (seed release induced primarily by drying conditions not generated by fire) bears intrinsic adaptive values, independent of those of pyriscence (fire-induced seed release). 2 We used seed-traps to quantify seed release in two scrubland pine stands in Israel. Contemporary meteorological data were used to seek correlations with climatic factors affecting seed release. 3 Substantial seed release, estimated to be about 60\% of the annual crop, was observed in the absence of fire. Seed release was distinctly seasonal, with high rates in spring and autumn, and was strongly correlated with short, infrequent but temporally predictable Sharav events (dry and hot weather). In the most extensive Sharav-induced seed release, seed density reached 117 seeds m–2 and 15\% of the annual crop was released within 6 days. Stepwise multiple regression revealed that mean relative humidity (in both stands) and maximum temperature (in one stand) were significant predictors of seed release. 4 Vertical (upwards) wind velocity was significantly positively correlated with dry and hot weather. Seed counts in distant traps ({$>$} 20 m from the nearest tree) were significantly greater in periods in which Sharav events occurred than in other periods. Xeriscence may therefore have an adaptive value in promoting dispersal distance by wind. 5 Both xeriscence and pyriscence appear to be involved in determining serotiny in P. halepensis and provide means of exploiting establishment opportunities generated either by fire or by other factors.},

By contrast, the southern California fires of December 2017 occurred during the longest Santa Ana wind event on record, resulting in the largest wildfire in California\&rsquo;s modern history. Both fire events occurred following an exceptionally wet winter that was preceded by a severe four-year drought. Fuels were further preconditioned by the warmest summer and autumn on record in northern and southern California, respectively. Finally, delayed onset of autumn precipitation allowed for critically low dead fuel moistures leading up to the wind events. Fire weather conditions were well forecast several days prior to the fire. However, the rarity of fire-weather conditions that occurred near populated regions, along with other societal factors such as limited evacuation protocols and limited wildfire preparedness in communities outside of the traditional wildland urban interface were key contributors to the widespread wildfire impacts.},

  abstract     = {Temperate forest soils store globally significant amounts of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Understanding how soil pools of these two elements change in response to disturbance and management is critical to maintaining ecosystem services such as forest productivity, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water resource protection. Fire is one of the principal disturbances acting on forest soil C and N storage and is also the subject of enormous management efforts. In the present article, we use meta-analysis to quantify fire effects on temperate forest soil C and N storage. Across a combined total of 468 soil C and N response ratios from 57 publications (concentrations and pool sizes), fire had significant overall effects on soil C (−26\%) and soil N (−22\%). The impacts of fire on forest floors were significantly different from its effects on mineral soils. Fires reduced forest floor C and N storage (pool sizes only) by an average of 59\% and 50\%, respectively, but the concentrations of these two elements did not change. Prescribed fires caused smaller reductions in forest floor C and N storage (−46\% and −35\%) than wildfires (−67\% and −69\%), and the presence of hardwoods also mitigated fire impacts. Burned forest floors recovered their C and N pools in an average of 128 and 103 years, respectively. Among mineral soils, there were no significant changes in C or N storage, but C and N concentrations declined significantly (−11\% and −12\%, respectively). Mineral soil C and N concentrations were significantly affected by fire type, with no change following prescribed burns, but significant reductions in response to wildfires. Geographic variation in fire effects on mineral soil C and N storage underscores the need for region-specific fire management plans, and the role of fire type in mediating C and N shifts (especially in the forest floor) indicates that averting wildfires through prescribed burning is desirable from a soils perspective.},

  abstract     = {It is well known that burning of vegetation stimulates new plant growth and landscape regeneration. The discovery that char and smoke from such fires promote seed germination in many species indicates the presence of chemical stimulants. Nitrogen oxides stimulate seed germination, but their importance in post-fire germination has been questioned. Cyanohydrins have been recently identified in aqueous smoke solutions and shown to stimulate germination of some species through the slow release of cyanide. However, the most information is available for karrikins, a family of butenolides related to 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one. Karrikins stimulate seed germination and influence seedling growth. They are active in species not normally associated with fire, and in Arabidopsis they require the F-box protein MAX2, which also controls responses to strigolactone hormones. We hypothesize that chemical similarity between karrikins and strigolactones provided the opportunity for plants to employ a common signal transduction pathway to respond to both types of compound, while tailoring specific developmental responses to these distinct environmental signals.},

  abstract = {We examined the seasonal variation in total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations in branch, trunk, and root tissues of Anacardiumexcelsum, Lueheaseemannii, Cecropialongipes, and Ureracaracasana growing in a seasonally dry forest in Panama. Our main goals were: (1) to determine the main sites of carbohydrate storage, and (2) to determine if seasonal patterns of carbohydrate storage are related to seasonal asynchronies in carbon supply and demand. We expected asynchronies to be related to seasonal variation in water and light availability and to foliar and reproductive phenology. Cecropia and Urera are fully drought-deciduous and so we expected them to exhibit the most dramatic seasonal variation in TNC concentrations. We predicted that maximum carbon supply would occur when canopies were at their fullest and that maximum carbon demand would occur when leaves, flowers, and fruits were produced. The concentration of total non-structural carbohydrates was assessed monthly in wood tissue of roots and in wood and bark tissue of terminal branches. Trunk tissue was sampled bimonthly. All tissues sampled served as storage sites for carbohydrates. As predicted, TNC concentrations varied most dramatically in branches of Cecropia and Urera: a 4-fold difference was observed between dry season maxima and wet season minima in branch wood tissue. Peak concentrations exceeded 25\% in Urera and 30\% in Cecropia. Less dramatic but significant seasonal variation was observed in Anacardium and Luehea. In all species, minimum branch TNC concentrations were measured during canopy rebuilding. In Anacardium, maximum branch TNC concentrations occurred when canopies were at their fullest. In Cecropia, Urera, and Luehea, TNC concentrations continued to increase even as canopies thinned in the early dry season. The greater photosynthetic capacity of leaves produced at the beginning of the dry season and the potential for the export of carbohydrates from senescing leaves may explain this pattern. In all species, the phenology of carbon gain was more important than the phenology of reproduction in influencing seasonal carbohydrate patterns. The combination of high TNC concentrations and the large biomass of branches, trunks, and roots indicates these species are storing and moving large quantities of carbohydrates.},

  abstract     = {The fire history of Norra Kvills National Park in southeastern hemiboreal Sweden was reconstructed for the last 600 years by cross-dating of fire scars in trees, stumps and snags of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Between 1401 and 1770 forty different fires were recorded; fire frequency at point scale was 20 years, which is 3–4 times more frequent than in northern Sweden. Since 1770, no large fires have been recorded. This has had considerable consequences for the forest structure and fauna in that it has resulted in a shift from a Scots pine-dominated ecosystem to a fire-sensitive Norway spruce (Picea abies) system over large parts of the park. For rare late-successional species associated with Norway spruce (e.g. Fomitopsis rosea, a polyporous fungus and Ceruchus chrysomelinus, a beetle) this has been advantageous, while fire-, light- and thermophilous species like the saproxylic beetle Tragosoma depsarium may be increasingly threatened if the process of spruce invasion and suppression of fires is allowed to continue. We discuss the importance and problems of incorporating fire in management plans of reserves and in forestry practices, with the aim of preserving the large number of species that are directly or indirectly dependent on fire in southern Sweden. \# 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract     = {1. Fires are nowadays small, yet frequent, in temperate Central European conifer forests, but little is known about the fire history in this region. This is likely due to the lack of intact forests that contain old trees and dead wood from which fire history may be reconstructed. An exception is the Białowieża Primeval Forest (BPF) in Poland for which we were able to reconstruct the fire history in detail. 2. From 886 tree ring samples collected in a 13-ha conifer-dominated area, we reconstructed fire events and tree establishment back to the mid 1600s. From 1653 to the late 1700s fires were very frequent, with mean point (single tree) fire intervals of 18 years and mean stand scale fire intervals of 6 years. After 1781, the intervals between the fires increased dramatically, and since 1874 no major fire was recorded. 3. Tree establishment underwent substantial changes, closely tracking shifts in fire frequency. When fires were frequent, Pinus sylvestris establishment occurred only sporadically. Later, less frequent fires promoted massive establishment of both P. sylvestris and Picea abies. At present, only P. abies and a few deciduous trees regenerate. 4. Synthesis. We present the first high-resolution fire history in the Central European temperate lowland forest area. The discovery of old P. sylvestris trees and stumps with fire scars in many conifer-dominated parts of BPF show that fire was a major component in the past dynamics of this forest. We also show that historically, fires were recurring at very close intervals, supporting an open, Pinus-dominated forest. These result contrasts with the written history of BPF, which focus on a few, large fires from the past. Human influence on the fire regime was probably substantial, although the disentangling of climatic and human impacts needs further studies. We propose that fire should be increasingly taken into consideration in models of disturbance, vegetation development and forest openness in the whole Central European lowland forest region.},

  abstract = {The Four Faces Fire in the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park demonstrated that wildfires are a significant threat to resources of cultural value associated with Cedar Mesa Sandstone cliffs. Two threatening conditions to cultural resources are carbon blackening and fire-induced exfoliation. At present, evidence on the nature and causes of fire-induced exfoliation of Cedar Mesa Sandstone cliff face structures in upper Salt Creek are not conclusive. However, several reactions may be responsible. Variable expansion-contraction ratios between the parent rock formation and the cliff face surfaces may have become incompatible during the rapid heating. Elevated cliff face temperature cooling may have also caused cliff face exfoliation. Additionally, trapped moisture between the cliff face surface and the parent rock formation may have been converted to steam and steam pressure during the fire, resulting in cliff face fracturing and exfoliation. Although this paper addresses observations and hypotheses regarding fire effects on Cedar Mesa Sandstone, other geologic formations may respond in a similar fashion endangering associative sites of cultural value. Management agencies will, we hope, address cliff face exfoliation possibilities in future fire test programs to determine causes of this phenomenon and develop effective policies to ensure the protection of associative, nonrenewable cultural resources. -- AATA},

At the regional scale, Wre favours phenotypic and phylogenetic clustering in Mediterranean woody plant communities. Nevertheless, the incidence of Wre within a Wre-prone region may present strong variations at the local, landscape scale. This study tests the prediction that woody communities on acid, nutrient-poor soils should exhibit more pronounced phenotypic and phylogenetic clustering patterns than woody communities on fertile soils, as a consequence of their higher Xammability and, hence, presumably higher propensity to recurrent Wre. Results conWrm the predictions and show that habitat Wltering driven by Wre may be detected even in local communities from an already WreWltered regional Xora. They also provide a new perspective from which to consider a preponderant role of Wre as a key evolutionary force in acid, infertile Mediterranean heathlands.},

Risk assessment is needed primarily to compare environmental effects of management alternatives, including effects on habitat for threatened and endangered species. This need for comparative risk assessment (CRA) is driven by policies requiring federal agencies to consider risks and other adverse effects, as well as benefits, when planning and implementing land and resource management projects. An active, adaptive approach to wildfire risk management is highly desirable. Clear objectives are needed, consistent with a long-term vision of what the land should look like. Effective risk communications can help organizations build trust with stakeholders. Several improvements in existing laws and policies could encourage comparisons of active management risks and risk-reduction benefits with risks of no action when fuel loads may result in uncharacteristically severe wildfire effects on resource values, including fish and wildlife habitat. Despite some weaknesses, CRA asks important questions and encourages more transparent decision-making processes.},

  abstract     = {A high-resolution, continuous 10,500 cal. yrs-long macroscopic charcoal record from a peat and lake sediment deposit at Storasjö, in the hemiboreal vegetation zone of southern Sweden, is presented. This record was compared with the microscopic charcoal record from the same core, and tentatively correlated with the macroscopic and microscopic charcoal records from another site (Stavsåkra), situated 30 km West of Storasjö. The charcoal records are also compared with regional climate proxy records with the aim to separate climate — from human-induced fire activity. The results suggest that the major signal of both microscopic and macroscopic charcoal records represents local fire history. The best record of local fire history was obtained from the continuous macroscopic charcoal analysis. A tentative correlation of the charcoal records between the sites indicates that most fire episodes of the early and middle Holocene are probably of regional character. Both sites exhibit three major phases of high fire activity 1) 8700–8300 BC, 2) 7250 BC to ca. 4000 BC, and 3) 750 BC to the 19th century. These three phases are separated by periods with lower or very low fire activity. This general trend is in good agreement with the pattern emerging for Europe from the analysis of the recently developed global charcoal database. Fire appears to have been controlled by climate during the early and middle Holocene and by humans during the late Holocene. Warmer and drier climate during the early and middle Holocene caused frequent and intensive fires, which suggests that natural fire activity might increase under predicted future climate scenarios. The results also suggest that fire was an important disturbance factor in the hemiboreal vegetation zone of Sweden and played an important role in the forest dynamics and characteristics of the flora and fauna of the region.},

  abstract     = {Forest fires are an important disturbance in the boreal forest. They are influenced by climate, weather, topography, vegetation, surface deposits, and human activities. In return, forest fires affect the climate through emission of gases and aerosols, and changes in surface albedo, soil processes, and vegetation dynamics. The net effect of these factors is not yet well established but seems to have caused a negative feedback on climate during the 20th century. However, an increase in boreal forest fires is predicted by the end of the 21st century, possibly changing the effect of fires on climate change to a positive feedback that would exacerbate global warming. This review presents (1) an overview of fire regimes and vegetation succession in boreal forests; (2) the effects on climate of combustion emissions and post-fire changes in ecosystem functioning; (3) the effects of fire regime variations on climate, especially on carbon stock and surface albedo; (4) an integrative approach of fire effects on climate dynamics; and (5) the implications of increased fire activity on global warming by calculating the radiative forcing of several factors by 2100 in the boreal region, before discussing the results and exposing the limits of the data at hand. Generally, losses of carbon from forest fires in the boreal region will increase in the future and their effect on the carbon stock (0.37 W/m2/decade) will be greater than the effect of fire on surface albedo (−0.09 W/m2/decade). The net effect of aerosol emissions from boreal fires will likely cause a positive feedback on global warming. This review emphasizes the importance of feedbacks between fires and climate in the boreal forest. It presents limitations and uncertainties to be addressed in future studies, particularly with regards to the effect of CO2 fertilization on forest productivity, which could offset or mitigate the effect of fire.},

A reexamination of fire management in Kruger National Park is currently under review with the objective to maintain natural ecosystem dynamics and favour tourists' ability to observe animals. We used data on location, intensity and frequency of fires and census data on three species considered as rare and of conservation concern in the park, tsessebe, roan and sable antelope to estimate the relationship between fire occurrence and species occurrence and density. We also investigated the impacts of different environmental predictors on antelope populations. The model predictors that most affected the density and presence of antelopes were mean fire return period, the type of geological substrate and the presence of water-points. We then used our models to evaluate different fire management scenarios and make recommendations for an optimal fire management strategy for the conservation of these rare antelopes. We also tested our scenarios under different precipitation conditions, in order to investigate the likely response of species to climate change. Roan antelope is the most sensitive species to climatic variations, while sable seems to be the most resilient. The approach described here can also be used to improve the conservation of locally rare species in other regions and habitats.},

Wood stake mass loss was generally higher for aspen, especially in the mineral soil of burned plots, than in control plots after 5 years. Soil surface and interface (unburned stands only) stakes showed few significant differences for either species on the Bitterroot National Forest. On the Gallatin National Forest, both pine and aspen stakes had significantly greater mass loss at the interface (unburned stand) at the end of 5 years, and also decayed significantly faster at the 10–20-cm depth in the wildfire area. Using wood stakes as an index of soil microsite properties in burned and unburned plots, we show that fire increased both OM decomposition and mineral soil microsite variability.

In this paper we investigate the global patterns of fire seasonality, which we relate to climatic, anthropogenic, land-cover and land-use variables. Location Global, with detailed analyses from single 1°× 1° grid cells. Methods We use a fire risk index, the Chandler burning index (CBI), as an indicator of the ‘natural’, eco-climatic fire seasonality, across all types of ecosystems. A simple metric, the middle of the fire season, is computed from both gridded CBI data and satellite-derived fire detections. We then interpret the difference between the eco-climatic and observed metrics as an indicator of the human footprint on fire seasonality. Results Deforestation, shifting cultivation, cropland production or tropical savanna fires are associated with specific timings due to land-use practices, sometimes largely decoupled from the CBI dynamics. Detailed time series from relevant locations provide comprehensive information about these practices and how they are adapted to eco-climatic conditions. Main conclusions We find a great influence of anthropogenic activities on global patterns of fire seasonality. The specificity of the main fire practices and their easy identification from global observation is a potential tool to support land-use monitoring efforts. Our results should also prove valuable in the development of a methodological approach for improving the representation of anthropogenic fire practices in dynamic global vegetation models.},

  abstract     = {During a haze event in Baltimore, U.S.A. from July 6 to 8, 2002, smoke from forest fires in the Que´ bec region (Canada), degraded air quality and impacted upon local climate, decreasing solar radiation and air temperature. The smoke particles in and above the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) served as a tracer and provided a unique opportunity to investigate the ABL structure, especially entrainment. Elastic backscatter lidar measurements taken during the haze event distinctly reveal the downward sweeps (or wisps) of smoke-laden air from the free atmosphere into the ABL. Visualisations of mechanisms such as dry convection, the entrainment process, detrainment, coherent entrainment structures, and mixing inside the ABL, are presented. Thermals overshooting at the ABL top are shown to create disturbances in the form of gravity waves in the free atmosphere aloft, as evidenced by a corresponding ripple structure at the bottom of the smoke layer. Lidar data, aerosol groundbased measurements and supporting meteorological data are used to link free atmosphere, mixed-layer and ground-level aerosols. During the peak period of the haze event (July 7, 2002), the correlation between time series of elastic backscatter lidar data within the mixed layer and the scattering coefficient from a nephelometer at ground level was found to be high (R ¼ 0.96 for z ¼ 324 m, and R ¼ 0.89 for z ¼ 504 m). Ground-level aerosol concentration was at a maximum about 2 h after the smoke layer intersected with the growing ABL, confirming that the wisps do not initially reach the ground.},

To address this issue, I examined the response and recovery of insect populations after fire within small, isolated tallgrass prairie remnants in northern Illinois, northwestern Indiana, and southeastern Wisconsin. I conducted this research over seven seasons, focused on responses at the species level, distinguished between remnant-dependent and remnant-independent species, and included multiple fire events and sites. I used sweep nets, light traps, sticky traps, and visual searches to gauge population responses and to track negatively affected populations to recovery. Most species (93\%) responded consistently to prescribed fires. Postfire responses ranged from positive (26\%) to negative (40\%) for 151 species representing 33 families and seven orders. Three attributes—remnant-dependence, upland inhabitance, and nonvagility—were significant predictors of negative postfire response. Among negatively affected populations, 68\% recovered within 1 year; all 163 populations tracked to recovery did so in 2 years or less. My results support the judicious use of rotational cool-season burning within small, isolated grassland sites.},

  abstract = {Wildland fire is an important disturbance agent in the western US and globally. However, the natural role of fire has been disrupted in many regions due to the influence of human activities, which have the potential to either exclude or promote fire, resulting in a “fire deficit” or “fire surplus”, respectively. In this study, we developed a model of expected area burned for the western US as a function of climate from 1984 to 2012. We then quantified departures from expected area burned to identify geographic regions with fire deficit or surplus. We developed our model of area burned as a function of several climatic variables from reference areas with low human influence; the relationship between climate and fire is strong in these areas. We then quantified the degree of fire deficit or surplus for all areas of the western US as the difference between expected (as predicted with the model) and observed area burned from 1984 to 2012. Results indicate that many forested areas in the western US experienced a fire deficit from 1984 to 2012, likely due to fire exclusion by human activities. We also found that large expanses of non-forested regions experienced a fire surplus, presumably due to introduced annual grasses and the prevalence of anthropogenic ignitions. The heterogeneity in patterns of fire deficit and surplus among ecoregions emphasizes fundamentally different ecosystem sensitivities to human influences and suggests that large-scale adaptation and mitigation strategies will be necessary in order to restore and maintain resilient, healthy, and naturally functioning ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract: Fire management is increasingly focusing on introducing heterogeneity in burning patterns under the assumption that “pyrodiversity begets biodiversity.” This concept has been formalized as patch mosaic burning (PMB), in which fire is manipulated to create a mosaic of patches representative of a range of fire histories to generate heterogeneity across space and time. Although PMB is an intuitively appealing concept, it has received little critical analysis. Thus we examined ecosystems where PMB has received the most attention and has been the most extensively implemented: tropical and subtropical savannas of Australia and Africa. We identified serious shortcomings of PMB: the ecological significance of different burning patterns remains unknown and details of desired fire mosaics remain unspecified. This has led to fire-management plans based on pyrodiversity rhetoric that lacks substance in terms of operational guidelines and capacity for meaningful evaluation. We also suggest that not all fire patterns are ecologically meaningful: this seems particularly true for the highly fire-prone savannas of Australia and South Africa. We argue that biodiversity-needs-pyrodiversity advocacy needs to be replaced with a more critical consideration of the levels of pyrodiversity needed for biodiversity and greater attention to operational guidelines for its implementation.},

  abstract  = {In the southern Great Plains, the greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) is confined to tallgrass prairie, a habitat now largely converted to agriculture. Remaining prairie is highly fragmented and subjected to land management practices that greatly alter the ecosystem of this species. Chief among these practices are deliberate, large-scale spring burns associated with early intensive stocking of cattle. We used extensive data to infer how such fires affect the prairie-chicken’s lekking and nesting behavior. From 1998 to 2000, 60–79.4\% of our study area—a 45,000-ha expanse of tallgrass prairie in north-central Oklahoma—was burned in spring. Prairiechickens tended to lek on unburned areas but not in a pattern that differed from random habitat choice. Leks on burns tended to be Ͻ200 m from unburned prairie. Females strongly avoided nesting in areas burned in spring 1998 and 1999 (n Ͼ 25 nests/y). Nesting effort was poor in 2000, prohibiting statistical analysis, but 5 of 8 nests were on unburned prairie. Incorporating data from 1997 (n ϭ 12 nests), only 14 of 74 nests were placed on burned prairie, and only 5 of the 64 nests from 1998 to 2000 were located on prairie burned all three of those years. Avoidance of burns was particularly strong before June. Despite strong avoidance, nest success did not differ between burned or unburned prairie. Our findings raise two concerns: 1) if leks are established only Ͻ200 m from unburned prairie, then an increase in the proportion of burns may inhibit lek formation, and, more important, 2) if females avoid nesting on recent burns, then an increase in the proportion of burns may cause a female to concentrate nesting effort on small patches (or forego nesting). We recommend moderation of spring burning (e.g., patch burning) of tallgrass prairie, lest the greater prairie-chicken be driven further from its already piecemeal habitat.},

  abstract     = {Lignotubers are swollen woody structures located at the root-shoot transition zone and contain numerous dormant buds and starch reserves. This structure enables the plant to resprout prolifically after severe disturbances that remove the aboveground biomass. These are considered adaptive traits in ecosystems with highly frequent and severe disturbances—such as fire-prone ecosystems. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the knowledge of lignotubers in the Mediterranean basin and highlight the evolutionary implications. We first summarise existing knowledge on lignotuber species in the Mediterranean basin. We then provide a detailed morpho-anatomical description of early lignotubers in two common woody species (Arbutus unedo L. and Phillyrea angustifolia L.). Finally, we compare our anatomical results with those obtained in studies conducted with other lignotuberous species from different Mediterranean regions. Lignotubers were verified in 14 species in the Mediterranean basin; all being from lineages with origins dating to the Tertiary and thus pre-dating the Mediterranean climate. In A. unedo and P. angustifolia, lignotubers are macroscopically discernible in 4- and 2-year-old saplings, respectively. In these two species, the lignotubers have numerous buds protected by hypertrophied scales, and have a contorted xylem containing abundant starch. Our results challenge the traditional idea that pre-Mediterranean lineages suffered evolutionary inertia; instead, lignotuberous species may be considered examples of plants that adapted to the increased fire activity that occurred throughout the Tertiary and Quaternary. We also highlight the use of morpho-anatomical traits to unambiguously distinguish between lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous resprouting species.},

Quercus suber trees resprout after fire, some from stem buds and others from basal buds only. In the former case the canopy recovers quickly. In the latter case the stem dies but the tree survives and regrows from basal sprouts. The probability of stem death and the degree of height recovery were studied after a fire in a Q. suber forest in NE Spain using logistic regression analysis. The results suggest that most trees survive after fire; the probability of stem death is negatively related to tree diameter; and recovery is positively related to tree diameter and to bark thickness. Implication for management and conservation of cork-oak forests are discussed.},

  abstract = {Fire is a dominant ecological factor in Mediterranean ecosystems, and changes in the fire regime can have important consequences for the stability of our landscapes. In this framework I asked firstly, what is the trend in fire number and area burned in the eastern Iberian Peninsula, and then, to what extent is the inter-annual variability of fires determined by climatic factors. To answer these questions I analysed the meteorological data (temperature and precipitation) from 350 stations covering the eastern Iberian Peninsula (1950–2000), and the fire records for the same area (historical data, 1874–1968, and data from recent decades, 1968–2000). The results suggested a slight tendency towards decreasing summer rainfall and a clear pattern of increasing annual and summer temperatures (on average, annual temperatures increased 0.35 ◦C per decade from 1950 to 2000). The analysis of fire records suggested a clear increase in the annual number of fires and area burned during the last century; however, in the last three decades the number of fires also increased but the area burned did not show a clear trend. For this period the inter-annual variability in area burned was significantly related to the summer rainfall, that is, in wet summers the area burned was lower that in dry summers. Furthermore, summer rainfall was significantly cross-correlated with summer area burned for a time-lag of 2 years, suggesting that high rainfall may increase fuel loads that burn 2 years later.},

  abstract = {The two main assembly processes claimed to structure plant communities are habitat filtering and competitive interactions. The set of species growing in fire-prone communities has been filtered in such a way that species without fire-persistence traits have not successfully entered the community. Because plant traits are evolutionarily conserved and fire traits are correlated with other plant traits, communities under high fire frequency should not include all possible trait combinations, and thus the morphospace occupation by species in these communities should be lower than expected by chance (underoccupied). In contrast, communities under low fire frequency would lack the filtering factor, and thus their underoccupation of the morphospace is not expected. We test this prediction by comparing the morphospace occupation by species in communities located in the western Mediterranean Basin, five of them subject to high fire frequency (HiFi) and four to low fire frequency (LowFi). We first compile a set of morphological and functional traits for the species growing on the nine sites, then we compute the morphospace occupation of each site as a convex hull volume, and finally, to assert that our results are not a product of a random branching pattern of evolution, we simulate our traits under a null model of neutral evolution and compare the morphospace occupation of the simulated traits with the results from the empirical data. The results suggest that, as predicted, there is a clear differential morphospace occupation between communities under different fire regimes in such a way that the morphospace is underoccupied in HiFi communities only. The simulation of a neutral evolutionary model does not replicate the observed pattern of differential morphospace occupation, and thus it should be attributed to assembly processes. In conclusion, our results suggest that fire is a strong community assembling process, filtering the species that have fire-persistent traits and thus assembling phenotypically and phylogenetically clustered communities with vacant zones in the morphospace.},

  abstract     = {Despite long-time awareness of the importance of the location of buds in plant biology, research on belowground bud banks has been scant. Terms such as lignotuber, xylopodium and sobole, all referring to belowground bud-bearing structures, are used inconsistently in the literature. Because soil efficiently insulates meristems from the heat of fire, concealing buds below ground provides fitness benefits in fire-prone ecosystems. Thus, in these ecosystems, there is a remarkable diversity of bud-bearing structures. There are at least six locations where belowground buds are stored: roots, root crown, rhizomes, woody burls, fleshy swellings and belowground caudexes. These support many morphologically distinct organs. Given their history and function, these organs may be divided into three groups: those that originated in the early history of plants and that currently are widespread (bud-bearing roots and root crowns); those that also originated early and have spread mainly among ferns and monocots (nonwoody rhizomes and a wide range of fleshy underground swellings); and those that originated later in history and are strictly tied to fire-prone ecosystems (woody rhizomes, lignotubers and xylopodia). Recognizing the diversity of belowground bud banks is the starting point for understanding the many evolutionary pathways available for responding to severe recurrent disturbances.},

The experiment was carried out in a shrubland area located in Sardinia, Italy. LFMC and time to ignition or ID time values were determined monthly or twice a month throughout the year. Ignitability was determined by laboratory tests. Meteorological data were also collected from a weather station located in the study area. Significant linear regression equations of ID time v. LFMC were found for most of the species, with R2 values ranging from 67 to 94\%. In general, very low values of ID time were observed when LFMC ranged from 70 to 100\%. In addition, two groups of species were identified, depending on seasonal changes of both LFMC and ID time (or ignitability): (i) species with LFMC not greater than 100\% and high ignitability values all throughout the year, and (ii) species with large seasonal variability of LFMC and ignitability values that were low in winter and high in summer. Significant differences in ignitability among species were also observed.},

  abstract = {Wildland fires are occurring more frequently and affecting more of Earth's surface than ever before. These fires affect the properties of soils and the processes by which they form, but the nature of these impacts has not been well understood. Given that healthy soil is necessary to sustain biodiversity, ecosystems and agriculture, the impact of fire on soil is a vital field of research.
Fire Effects on Soil Properties brings together current research on the effects of fire on the physical, biological and chemical properties of soil. Written by over 60 international experts in the field, it includes examples from fire-prone areas across the world, dealing with ash, meso and macrofauna, smouldering fires, recurrent fires and management of fire-affected soils. It also describes current best practice methodologies for research and monitoring of fire effects and new methodologies for future research. This is the first time information on this topic has been presented in a single volume and the book will be an important reference for students, practitioners, managers and academics interested in the effects of fire on ecosystems, including soil scientists, geologists, forestry researchers and environmentalists.},

  abstract     = {Semi-natural open habitats have drastically changed in the last few decades due to agricultural intensification and rural depopulation. Steppe-birds, and especially those adapted to primary stages of vegetation succession, are threatened by an increase in scrub cover, and management actions are being applied to reverse scrub encroachment and restore habitat suitability in semi-natural open habitats. In this paper we evaluated for the first time, the long-term effects of a wildfire on habitat structure, vegetation productivity, and the associated response of an endangered scrub-steppe specialist bird, the Dupont’s Lark Chersophilus duponti. Wildfire occurred in a Mediterranean steppe of central Spain dominated by permanent community of dwarf cushions scrubs. Bird abundance was evaluated by line transects in the burnt and unburnt areas 3~years prior to the fire and 4 and 7~years after the fire. We quantified changes in habitat structure at fine scale level through vegetation sampling points and in vegetation productivity by estimating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Fire had strong effects for at least up to 4~years after the fire, when lower NDVI values, less scrub cover and fewer, but not significant, number of males were detected in the burnt area with respect to the pre-fire conditions. Seven years after fire most vegetation variables measured did not differ between areas, number of males detected within the burnt area was recovered and NDVI values in burnt area were slightly recovered but were significantly lower than in control area. Slow regeneration of the scrub cover after fire explained the unsuccessful occupation of the burnt area by the Dupont’s Lark up to several years after fire. The more dispersed and shorter habitat created by fire 7~years after the fire seems to be more suitable for the species than that in control areas. The large number of males around the burnt area may have played a role in the recolonization process. In sum, vegetation recovery and the presence of a low scrub-steppe specialist, as the Dupont’s lark, suggests that fire management could be integrated into conservation plans to effectively manage scrub encroachment processes in Mediterranean scrub-steppes.},

  abstract     = {At the time of Ma¯ori settlement, ca. 750 years ago, New Zealand’s ecosystems experienced catastrophic change, including the introduction of fire to ignition-limited ecosystems and the resulting widespread loss of forest. While high-resolution sediment-charcoal analyses suggest this forest loss was rapid, Ma¯ori populations were small and transient during the Initial Burning Period and there is evidence for widespread fire activity in places where there is little archaeological evidence of human presence. These observations beg the question ‘how did small populations manage to transform large areas so rapidly?’ Using a simulation model, we demonstrate how the relationship between time since fire and flammability in New Zealand’s forests drives positive feedbacks that allow for rapid and extensive deforestation. Under ignition scenarios mirroring prehuman conditions, the model did not produce significant deforestation – thus, it is extremely unlikely that deforestation could have occurred without human-initiated burning. Scenarios where ignition was spatio-temporally random also failed to result in deforestation. Rapid and widespread forest loss occurred in scenarios incorporating spatio-temporally savvy selection of ignition locations. Targeting ignitions in flammable vegetation was more important than targeting ignitions in years with favourable climatic conditions. However, targeting in space and time concurrently, such that flammable vegetation was ignited during favourable climatic years was the most efficient strategy of those simulated. Following the Initial Burning Period decadal ignitions would have been sufficient to maintain a deforested shrubland/grassland landscape. New Zealand’s Initial Burning Period is one of many that occurred across eastern Polynesia following human settlement, and these events have left long-term legacy effects that remain evident in contemporary landscapes. Improving understanding of how humans shaped environments in New Zealand in the past has implications for eastern Polynesia as a whole.},

  abstract     = {The first observationally based conceptual model for intense pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) development is described by applying reanalyzed meteorological model output to an inventory of 26 intense pyroCb events from June to August 2013 and a control inventory of intense fire activity without pyroCb. Results are based on 88 intense wildfires observed within the western United States and Canada. While surface-based fire weather indices are a useful indicator of intense fire activity, they are not a skillful predictor of intense pyroCb. Development occurs when a layer of increased moisture content and instability is advected over a dry, deep, and unstable mixed layer, typically along the leading edge of an approaching disturbance or under the influence of a monsoonal anticyclone. Upper-tropospheric dynamics are conducive to rising motion and vertical convective development. Mid- and upper-tropospheric conditions therefore resemble those that produce traditional dry thunderstorms. The specific quantity of midlevel moisture and instability required is shown to be strongly dependent on the surface elevation of the contributing fire. Increased thermal buoyancy from large and intense wildfires can serve as a potential trigger, implying that pyroCb occasionally develop in the absence of traditional meteorological triggering mechanisms. This conceptual model suggests that meteorological conditions favorable for pyroCb are observed regularly in western North America. PyroCb and ensuing stratospheric smoke injection are therefore likely to be significant and endemic features of summer climate. Results from this study provide a major step toward improved detection, monitoring, and prediction of pyroCb, which will ultimately enable improved understanding of the role of this phenomenon in the climate system.},

The hypotheses have been classified traditionally by the effect of the disturbance on the community: Those that involve selective mortality, which maintains the species diversity of a community in equilibrium, and those that invoke causing random, localized, mass mortality, which prevent the community from reaching and equilibrium. Regardless of this difference, most hypotheses predict that the greatest number of species will occur at intermediate leves of disturbance. We develop graphical models for equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations, which we show to differ only in respect to temporal and spatial scale. We maintain that the usual outcome-the greatest number of species at intermediate levels of disturbance-can be explained by assuming that there are trade-offs in species-specific abilities that place constraints on immigration to, and extinction in, patches. Changes in immigration and extinction, the process that govern patch diversity, depend on species-specific abilities to fend off competitors or to endure disturbances. Members of a species can resist competitors or resist disturbance, but they cannot excel at both. If this trade-off does not exist, then the highest level of species diversity will not occur at intermediate levels of disturbance. Furthermore, we show that if this assumption is relaxed or if interactions between the frequency and magnitude of disturbances are considered, other unexpected outcomes are posible.},

The goals of this review are to summarize the known and potential effects of fire and fuels management on amphibians and their aquatic habitats, and to identify information gaps to help direct future scientific research. Amphibians as a group are taxonomically and ecologically diverse; in turn, responses to fire and associated habitat alteration are expected to vary widely among species and among geographic regions. Available data suggest that amphibian responses to fire are spatially and temporally variable and incompletely understood. Much of the limited research has addressed short-term (1–3 years) effects of prescribed fire on terrestrial life stages of amphibians in the southeastern United States. Information on the long-term negative effects of fire on amphibians and the importance of fire for maintaining amphibian communities is sparse for the majority of taxa in North America. Given the size and severity of recent wildland fires and the national effort to reduce fuels on federal lands, future studies are needed to examine the effects of these landscape disturbances on amphibians. We encourage studies to address population-level responses of amphibians to fire by examining how different life stages are affected by changes in aquatic, riparian, and upland habitats. Research designs need to be credible and provide information that is relevant for fire managers and those responsible for assessing the potential effects of various fuel reduction alternatives on rare, sensitive, and endangered amphibian species.},

However, for tropical savannas, little is known about the effects of fire on flower production at community and species scale, especially for the ground-layer.Aims: We assessed the role of fire as a trigger to short-term flowering in cerrado grassland, compared with unburned vegetation.Methods: We recorded the presence of flowers or fruits in 2,441 individuals from 47 plant species (grasses, forbs and subshrubs), during 6 months after fire, in burned and unburned areas of cerrado grasslands, in south-eastern Brazil.Results: In the burned areas, 63\% of individuals sampled flowered, in contrast to 19\% in unburned areas, demonstrating a strong and positive effect of fire on plant communities of cerrado grasslands. Fire significantly induced flowering in 79\% of the studied species, of which 20 species flowered only after fire (nine grasses, seven subshrubs and four forbs).Conclusions: These results highlight the role of fire triggering important ecological processes in the cerrado grasslands, potentially benefiting seed production and genetic diversity of many species. Fire is a crucial factor to be maintained for conservation of these ecosystems and their biodiversity.},

  abstract     = {Fire is an important driver of change in most forest, savannah, and prairie ecosystems and fire-altered organic matter, or pyrogenic carbon (PyC), conveys numerous functions in soils of fire-maintained terrestrial ecosystems. Although an exceptional number of recent review articles and books have addressed agricultural soil application of charcoal or biochar, few reviews have addressed the functional role of naturally formed PyC in fire-maintained ecosystems. Recent advances in molecular spectroscopic techniques have helped strengthen our understanding of PyC as a ubiquitous, complex material that is capable of altering soil chemical, physical, and biological properties and processes. The uniquely recalcitrant nature of PyC in soils is partly a result of its stable C = C double-bonded, graphene-like structure and C-rich, N-poor composition. This attribute allows it to persist in soils for hundreds to thousands of years and represent net ecosystem C sequestration in fire-maintained ecosystems. The rapid formation of PyC during wildfire or anthropogenic fire events short-circuits the normally tortuous pathway of recalcitrant soil C formation. Existing literature also suggests that PyC provides an essential role in the cycling of certain nutrients, greatly extending the timeframe by which fires influence soil processes and facilitating recovery in ecosystems where organic matter inputs are low and post-fire surface soil bacterial and fungal activity is reduced. The high surface area of PyC allows for the adsorption a broad spectrum of organic compounds that directly or indirectly influence microbial processes after fire events. Adsorption capacity and microsite conditions created by PyC yields a “charosphere” effect in soil with heightened microbial activity in the vicinity of PyC. In this mini-review, we explore the function of PyC in natural and semi-natural settings, provide a mechanistic approach to understanding these functions, and examine examples of such mechanisms in published literature.},

  abstract     = {Soil heating caused by prescribed or wildland fire commonly focuses on a single biological thermal threshold of 60 °C for the duration of one minute to represent organism death. This metric severely misrepresents the heterogeneity of the soil environment, the physiological attributes and tolerances of organisms, and the complexity of heat transfer through soils. Measurements of biotic death in simulated laboratory experiments render research findings difficult to extrapolate to forest and grassland soils. The disparity between assumed biological responses and the diversity of biological responses after wildland fire events calls for a thorough review of soil biological heating thresholds. In this review, we synthesize and compare research that directly relates soil heating temperature and duration to biological responses, provide relevant models for temperature-duration responses of soil organisms in lieu of a strict threshold, and recommend applications of soil heating data for wildland fire and ecosystem management. For no single study or group of organisms was a threshold of 60 °C for one-minute duration evidenced. All soil organisms reviewed, which included roots, mesofauna, bacteria, fungi, microbial biomass, and soil respiration, displayed both positive and negative responses to soil heating across temperature and duration gradients. We, therefore, discourage the use of the traditionally accepted metric of 60 °C for the duration of one minute. Instead, we present models of duration-temperature relationships of soil biota and invite interdisciplinary efforts from researchers and managers to directly measure biological responses on a case-bycase basis.},

Xylem hydraulic properties and vulnerability to cavitation (determined using the air-injection method) were studied in six Pinaceae of the northern Rocky Mountains: Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Larix occidentalis, Pinus contorta, Pinus albicaulis and Abies lasiocarpa. We tested whether species extending into drier habitats exhibited increased resistance to water stress-induced cavitation, and whether there is a trade-off between xylem transport capacity and resistance to cavitation. 2. At lower elevations the more drought-tolerant P. ponderosa was much less resistant to cavitation than the codominant P. menziesii. Greater vulnerability to cavitation in P. ponderosa was compensated for, at least in part, by increased stomatal control of water loss (inferred from carbon isotope discrimination) and by increased sapwood to leaf area ratios. Similar differences, but less pronounced, were found in codominant species at higher elevations. 3. Leaf specific hydraulic conductivity was negatively correlated with mean cavitation pressure. When species were separated into pines and non-pines, sapwood specific conductivity and mean cavitation pressure were also negatively correlated within each of the two groups. 4. Our results indicate that within the evergreen conifers examined, greater resistance to water stress-induced cavitation is not required for survival in more xeric habitats, and that there is a trade-off between xylem conductance and resistance to cavitation.},

  abstract     = {Fire seasonality, an important characteristic of fire regimes, commonly is delineated using seasons based on single weather variables (rainfall or temperature). We used nonparametric cluster analyses of a 17-year (1993–2009) data set of weather variables that influence likelihoods and spread of fires (relative humidity, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, soil moisture) to explore seasonality of fire in pine savanna-grassland landscapes at the Avon Park Air Force Range in southern Florida. A four-variable, three-season model explained more variation within fire weather variables than models with more seasons. The three-season model also delineated intra-annual timing of fire more accurately than a conventional rainfall-based two-season model. Two seasons coincided roughly with dry and wet seasons based on rainfall. The third season, which we labeled the fire season, occurred between dry and wet seasons and was characterized by fire-promoting conditions present annually: drought, intense solar radiation, low humidity, and warm air temperatures. Fine fuels consisting of variable combinations of pyrogenic pine needles, abundant C4 grasses, and flammable shrubs, coupled with low soil moisture, and lightning ignitions early in the fire season facilitate natural landscape-scale wildfires that burn uplands and across wetlands. We related our three season model to fires with different ignition sources (lightning, military missions, and prescribed fires) over a 13-year period with fire records (1997–2009). Largest wildfires originate from lightning and military ignitions that occur within the early fire season substantially prior to the peak of lightning strikes in the wet season. Prescribed ignitions, in contrast, largely occur outside the fire season. Our delineation of a pronounced fire season provides insight into the extent to which different human-derived fire regimes mimic lightning fire regimes. Delineation of a fire season associated with timing of natural lightning ignitions should be useful as a basis for ecological fire management of humid savanna-grassland landscapes worldwide.},

An objective approach to intentional veld-burning is presented simulating the incidence of lightning fires, and the subjectivity in choosing areas to burn is reduced. The selection of areas to burn depends on the mean seasonal rainfall in each burning block, the time since it last burnt and the accumulation of herbaceous fuel. Additional factors considered are the moribundness in grasses, the game pressure and the cover of green vegetation derived from satellite data.},

  abstract     = {Fire has a major impact on the structure and function of many ecosystems globally. Pyrodiversity, the diversity of fires within a region (where diversity is based on fire characteristics such as extent, severity, and frequency), has been hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but changing climate and land management practices have eroded pyrodiversity. To assess whether changes in pyrodiversity will have impacts on ecological communities, we must first understand the mechanisms that might enable pyrodiversity to sustain biodiversity, and how such changes might interact with other disturbances such as drought. Focusing on plant–pollinator communities in mixed-conifer forest with frequent fire in Yosemite National Park, California, we examine how pyrodiversity, combined with drought intensity, influences those communities. We find that pyrodiversity is positively related to the richness of the pollinators, flowering plants, and plant–pollinator interactions. On average, a 5\% increase in pyrodiversity led to the gain of approximately one pollinator and one flowering plant species and nearly two interactions. We also find that a diversity of fire characteristics contributes to the spatial heterogeneity (b-diversity) of plant and pollinator communities. Lastly, we find evidence that fire diversity buffers pollinator communities against the effects of drought-induced floral resource scarcity. Fire diversity is thus important for the maintenance of flowering plant and pollinator diversity and predicted shifts in fire regimes to include less pyrodiversity compounded with increasing drought occurrence will negatively influence the richness of these communities in this and other forested ecosystems. In addition, lower heterogeneity of fire severity may act to reduce spatial turnover of plant–pollinator communities. The heterogeneity of community composition is a primary determinant of the total species diversity present in a landscape, and thus, lower pyrodiversity may negatively affect the richness of plant–pollinator communities across large spatial scales.},

The author proposes that progress requires understanding the physics and atmospheric dynamics behind the correlations. A conceptual 3-stage model of fire development, based on atmospheric structure, is presented. Using parcel theory and basic atmospheric dynamics equations, the author proposes possible causal explanations for some of the known correlations. The atmospheric dynamics are discussed in terms of the 3-stage model, but can also be viewed more generally. The overall goal is to reframe fire-atmosphere interactions in a way that will allow better understanding and progress in fire science, prediction, and safety.},

Smith to a range of fire intensities and inter-fire periods were simulated using a stage based matrix model. The model used published values for life history parameters and incorporated linear density dependence in fecundity and growth. Mild fires (i.e. those that killed to mature trees) with mean period between 2 to 8 years maintained a healthy stand structure. More frequent or more intense fires resulted in damage or extinction of the stand, whereas decreasing frequency or intensity yielded stands which were heavily stocked with saplings, few of which were recruited into the larger size classes. These results were largely insensitive to modification of life history parameters. We conclude that stands of C. intratropica on sites without topographic fire-protection must have been maintained by Aboriginal fire management. Observed damage and decline of C. intratropica stands is consistent with a reversion to uncontrolled fire regimes in the recent past.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed fire is practiced around the world to reduce the effect of unplanned fire, but we hypothesise that its effectiveness is proportional to the mean annual area burnt by unplanned fire, which varies among biomes. Fire history mapping was obtained for six global case studies from a range of biomes: Portugal, Spain (both Mediterranean), Alberta (boreal Canada), Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (montane USA), the Sandy Desert (arid Australia) and Kruger National Park (South African savanna). Leverage is the unit reduction in unplanned fire area resulting from one unit of previous fire as measured at a regional scale over a long period. We calculated leverage for each case study using statistical modelling of annual area burnt, controlling for annual climatic variation. We combined the six leverage values with those from four previously published cases to conduct a global test of our hypothesis. Leverage was high in Portugal (,0.9) and moderate in the Sandy Desert (,0.3). However, the other case studies showed no evidence of leverage: burnt area was not influenced by past fire. In all regions, climatic variation had more influence than past area burnt on annual area burnt. The global analysis revealed a positive relationship between mean area burnt and leverage but only when outlying cases were removed. In biomes with low fire activity, prescribed fire is unlikely to reduce unplanned fire area at all, while for many others, the return for effort is likely to be low. Lessons derived from one biome cannot necessarily be applied to another.},

  abstract     = {Gila trout, Oncorhynchus gilae, formerly occurred in suitable habitat in much of the Gila River drainage, New Mexico and Arizona, but, when described in 1950, it was restricted to a few remote headwater streams in New Mexico. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 and New Mexico Wildlife Conservation Act of 1974 afforded some protection and provided impetus for efforts to conserve the species. In the past 20 years, conservation efforts focused mainly on establishing additional populations. Success of recovery efforts has been mixed. Prior to 1989, 11 populations (five relictual and six re-established) existed. Natural events in 1988 and 1989 eliminated one population and severely reduced two others. A fourth population (natural) may be contaminated with genes of Oncorhynchus mykiss and its replicate therefore may be impure. Successful conservation of O. gilae will require continued protection and enhancement of extant populations, re-establishment of the species in large drainages rather than small headwater streams, and modification of traditional recovery strategies.},

While Biophysical Settings between the two sources matched approximately half of the time, only 2.5 \% of the area matched both FRCC and BpS simultaneously. The poor FRCC performance is largely due to undetected and extensive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) cover, overestimation of perennial native grass in extensive shrublands, and mapping confusion between true pinyon-juniper woodlands and areas where trees have encroached into native shrublands. LANDFIRE National products should be useful to resource-limited managers where sufficient training plots were available to the project, but we include practical guidance for using LANDFIRE spatial products in areas where the LANDFIRE project had insufficient ground plot information.},

  abstract     = {Upon the effect of atmospheric stability on air pollution, this study highlights the weakened diurnal evolution of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), which is crucial to the formation of regional fog-haze and air pollution episodes over eastern China (ECN). The decrease of atmospheric visibility (Vis) during 1973–2012 is found to be related to the more stable ABL with weakened diurnal evolution that is characterized by a concurrent weakening of surface wind, a decrease in ABL height, and a reduction of diurnal temperature range (DTR, – 0.26 and – 0.092 °C/10-years in the winter and summer, respectively). With a general synchronous variation, the increase in both aerosol loading and cloud cover might work in concert to reduce solar radiation reaching the surface, stabilize ABL and weaken the diurnal ABL evolution, thereby weakening the turbulent mixing of pollutants and enhancing air pollution. This conjecture of “aerosol, cloud – ABL – air pollution” feedback, with particular emphasis on the effect of cloud (in addition to the effect of aerosol) on the ABL evolution, is supported by our analysis of 40 years trends in the cloud, Vis and DTR from surface observation, the aerosol optical depth from MODIS, and the validated MERRA-2 reanalysis aerosol, cloud and boundary layer height (by surface observation and routine radiosonde sounding). Regarding the linkage between fog-haze and diurnal evolution of the ABL, the result emphasizes the effect of a persistent high relative humidity (RH), which is found to be important to the formation of regional persistent fog-haze episodes and must be carefully considered in future study. Therefore, a chain of processes is suggested to interpret the occurrence of regional persistent fog-haze episodes over ECN. First, during a polluted day, because of aerosol radiative effects, the high ABL stability and high RH can persist throughout the day, and consequently, favoring the accumulation of pollutants as well as the secondary formation and hygroscopic growth of aerosol. Second, the maintenance of such more stable, humid and polluted ABL is in contrast to a clear day when the ABL is more convective in the afternoon and facilitates the diffusion and dilution of pollutants. Third, under a persistent stable synoptic system, the increase of air pollution associated with the weakened diurnal evolution of ABL due to the “aerosol, cloud – ABL – air pollution” feedback, as described above, can be further strengthened, thereby renders more persistent and severe air pollution events. The DTR variation in relationship with the aerosol, cloud, ABL and air pollution is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Biochar application has become a novel and emergent technology for sequestering C, improving soil quality and crop production, and is a potential winewin strategy for ecosystem service delivery. Biochar addition can also stimulate soil microbial activity, and although it is unclear exactly why biochar should benefit soil microorganisms, it is thought that the large surface area and volume of pores provide a significant habitat for microbes. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial colonisation of wood-derived biochar that had been buried in an agricultural soil for three years. We have examined the level of colonisation on the internal and external surfaces of field-aged biochar by scanning electron microscopy, and used 14C-labelled glucose to quantify the rates of microbial activity in different spatial niches of the biochar and the surrounding soil. Microbial colonisation of field-aged biochar was very sparse, with no obvious differences between the external and internal surfaces. At the high field application rate of 50 t haÀ1, biochar contributed only 6.52 Æ 0.11\% of the total soil pore space and 7.35 Æ 0.81\% of the total soil surface area of the topsoil (0e30 cm). Further, 17.46 Æ 0.02\% of the biochar pores were effectively uninhabitable for most microbes, being {$<$}1 mm in diameter. The initial rate of microbial mineralization of 14C-labelled glucose was significantly greater in the control bulk soil and the soil immediately surrounding the biochar than on the biochar external and internal surfaces. However, lower C use efficiency values of microbes on, or within, the biochar also suggested lower available C status or differences in the structure of the microbial community in the biochar relative to the surrounding soil. This study suggests that, at least in the short term ( 3 y), biochar does not provide a significant habitat for soil microbes. While biochar is extremely recalcitrant and largely unavailable to soil microbes, changes in soil physicochemical properties and the introduction of metabolically available labile compounds into the surrounding soil (the ‘charosphere’) may significantly alter soil microbial activity and structure, which could ultimately affect soileplantemicrobe interactions. Therefore, before the wide-scale application of biochar to agricultural land is exploited, it is important that we understand further how the properties of biochar positively or negatively affect soil microbial communities, and in turn, how they interact with, and colonise biochar.},

Our objective was to examine yearly trends in bird abundance in relation to changing vegetation structure and composition and in relation to yearly weather variation. From 1969 to 1983 shrub cover on the burned plot increased from about 22\% to over 43\%, and density of overstory trees increased by about 50\%. Herb and grass cover decreased during this period, as did density of snags originally resulting from the fire. During this period of rapid postfire succession, total density of birds was nearly equal on the two plots but species richness increased on the burned plot compared with the unburned plot. Ground- and brush-foraging birds were more numerous on the burned plot, and their population size increased significantly from 1966 to 1985. Foliage-searching birds were more numerous on the unburned plot, and their populations were stable over time relative to the burned plot. In contrast, numbers of foliage-searching birds increased significantly on the burned plot. Bark-gleaning birds declined on the burned plot, probably in response to loss of snags used for nesting by most of these species. Variations in weather, as indicated by measures of temperature and precipitation, did not explain yearly variations in bird populations. Rather, changing vegetation structure resulted in predictable trends related to the foraging and nesting habits of the birds we studied.},

  abstract     = {This paper reports a study of ground-dwelling, small mammals in coastal eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia from 1970 through 2005. During this time, the study area burnt in an intense fire in December 1972 and was partially burnt in November 1980. Both fires were associated with prolonged drought. The mammals studied comprised two dasyurid marsupials, Antechinus agilis and A. swainsonii, two native murid rodents, Rattus fuscipes and R. lutreolus, and the introduced house mouse Mus musculus. After intensive sampling throughout the year from 1970 through 1972 to establish basic ecological and population parameters of the small mammal community, populations were sampled annually during late autumn and early winter before the onset of breeding. There were marked differences in the annual (autumn/winter) abundances of all species; numbers of A. agilis ranged from 4 to 142 individuals; A. swainsonii 0 to 43; R. fuscipes 4 to 54; R. lutreolus 0 to 11; M. musculus 0 to 23. Following the 1972 fire, numbers fell to the lowest level recorded during the study and each population subsequently disappeared from the plot between the 1973 and 1974 winter censuses. The less intense 1980 fire did not lead to extirpation, but numbers of A. agilis, A. swainsonii and R. fuscipes declined as drought conditions persisted through 1983. R. lutreolus occurred consistently only following the fires, when a grassy ground vegetation favoured by this species developed. Similarly, M. musculus colonised within two years of the fires and persisted on the plot for 3–4 years before disappearing. Following the fires, populations of the omnivorous R. fuscipes recovered first followed by the scansorial, insectivorous A. agilis and last by the fossorial, insectivorous A. swainsonii. Two primary conclusions emerged from this study. First, the intense fire of 1972 did not kill all the animals immediately, but led to the disappearance of each species from the plot over 18 months. Thus, intense fire had a delayed but catastrophic impact on small ground-dwelling mammals. The fluctuations in population levels, covering more than an order of magnitude, demonstrate that factors other than fire, such as rainfall and drought, drive the population dynamics of these small mammals. As stability and recovery are not features of local populations, long-term studies of benchmark populations are necessary to manage forest biodiversity.},

The variation in fire tolerance of species and the changes in the physical environment and plant communities following burns result in the development of distinctly different arthropod communities on frequently burned sites compared to sites protected from burning. Changing successional stages following burns also support distinctive arthropod species and groups. In general, a landscape containing sites at different successional stages, and sites varying in burn frequency, will support the most species; if a single site is burned at intervals, a cycle of arthropod species richness, species composition, and numbers of individuals will occur. It is possible to predict the responses of a prairie arthropod community or of a single species to a controlled burn or a series of burns if the fire history of the site, and the burn tolerance, colonizing ability, and basic biology of the species present, are known.},

However, a lack of change in the slopes (z-values) of species-area curves indicates that proportional changes were independent of scale of observation below 400~m2. Changes in species richness were predominantly driven by immigration, which was significantly related to fire severity. Survival of species present pre-fire was greater than local extinction, but neither was related to severity. 3 Species richness of trees increased at all scales but proportional increases were smaller at larger scales and slopes of species-area curves decreased after the fire. Local seedling recruitment increased species richness at small scales, but low rates of immigration due to dispersal limitation in most species limited increases at larger scales. 4 Directional changes in species richness of non-trees were not always consistent at fine scales but both absolute and relative changes were positive at scales ≥~1~m2 and increased with increasing scale. Slopes of species-area curves increased post-fire because localized patterns of immigration within plots resulted in little mixing of species at small scales but large changes in species richness at larger scales. 5 Fire in the southern Appalachians increases plant species richness within local communities, but rates of species turnover and patterns of beta diversity are maintained by local recruitment of tree seedlings at small scales and immigration of herb, shrub and vine species at larger scales. 6 Although decreased levels of competition after disturbance promote species coexistence at small scales, changes in species richness at larger scales are determined by the degree that the local community is linked to the species pool of the surrounding landscape through processes related to dispersal, particularly mass effects.},

  abstract = {Smouldering wildfires propagate slowly through surface and subsurface organic layers of the forest ground and severely affect the soil, producing physical, chemical and biological changes. These effects are caused by the prolonged heating and the large loss of soil mass but are poorly documented in the literature. A series of smouldering experiments with boreal peat have been conducted under laboratory conditions to quantify these effects using small-scale samples. Peat samples of 100 mm by 100 mm in cross section and 50 mm in depth of different moisture were exposed to an external ignition source. Thermocouples placed throughout the sample bed measured the temperature evolution and tracked the peat ignition, intensity and spread of the smouldering front. The results show that moisture content controls peat ignition and that moisture below 125 ± 10\% (in dry base) are required. The severity of the smouldering peat on the soil has been quantified in terms of temperature vs. residence time curves and mass loss. The measurements show temperatures in excess of 300 °C for residence times of 1 h leading to sterilization of the soil and mass loss in burnt layers above 90\%.},

  abstract     = {Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is considered one of the most stable components in soil and can represent more than 30\% of total soil organic carbon (SOC). However, few estimates of global PyC stock or distribution exist and thus PyC is not included in any global carbon cycle models, despite its potential major relevance for the soil pool. To obtain a global picture, we reviewed the literature for published PyC content in SOC data. We generated the first PyC database including more than 560 measurements from 55 studies. Despite limitations due to heterogeneous distribution of the studied locations and gaps in the database, we were able to produce a worldwide PyC inventory. We found that global PyC represent on average 13.7\% of the SOC and can be even up to 60\%, making it one of the largest groups of identifiable compounds in soil, together with polysaccharides. We observed a consistent range of PyC content in SOC, despite the diverse methods of quantification. We tested the PyC content against different environmental explanatory variables: fire and land use (fire characteristics, land use, net primary productivity), climate (temperature, precipitation, climatic zones, altitude) and pedogenic properties (clay content, pH, SOC content). Surprisingly, soil properties explain PyC content the most. Soils with clay content higher than 50\% contain significantly more PyC ({$>$} 30\% of the SOC) than with clay content lower than 5\% ({$<$} 6\% of the SOC). Alkaline soils contain at least 50\% more PyC than acidic soils. Furthermore, climatic conditions, represented by climatic zone or mean temperature or precipitation, correlate significantly with the PyC content. By contrast, fire characteristics could only explain PyC content, if site-specific information was available. Datasets derived from remote sensing did not explain the PyC content.
To show the potential of this database, we used it in combination with other global datasets to create a global worldwide PyC content and a stock estimation, which resulted in around 200Pg PyC for the uppermost 2 meters. These modelled estimates indicated a clear mismatch between the location of the current PyC studies and the geographical zones where we expect high PyC stocks.},

I suggest that the distributions of species within a region reveal more about the processes that generate diversity patterns than does the co-occurrence of species at any given point. The local community is an epiphenomenon that has relatively little explanatory power in ecology and evolutionary biology. Local coexistence cannot provide insight into the ecogeographic distributions of species within a region, from which local assemblages of species derive, nor can local communities be used to test hypotheses concerning the origin, maintenance, and regulation of species richness, either locally or regionally. Ecologists are moving toward a community concept based on interactions between populations over a continuum of spatial and temporal scales within entire regions, including the population and evolutionary processes that produce new species.},

I conclude that, due to this major disagreement on its very nature, biodiversity may be defined simply as a set of multivariate summary statistics for quantifying different characteristics of community structure.},

Previous studies have shown that roads have significant effects on fire ignition. However, since different land cover classes are subject to different levels of ignition risk, roads in different land cover classes may differently affect fire ignition. The aim of this paper is thus to assess the influence of roads on fire ignition in selected land cover classes subjected to different levels of anthropogenic pressure in Sardinia (Italy). Our results show that fires are preferentially ignited close to roads in all land cover classes. However, the influence of roads is much stronger in less impacted land uses, where the availability of human-induced ignitions highly depends on the accessibility networks. Our approach represents a first step towards the systematic integration of interacting fire ignition drivers such as roads and land cover into fire risk analysis.},

  abstract     = {Bull trout Salvelinus confluentus and other salmonids in the Pacific Northwest are believed at risk of local and regional extinctions because of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation. Biologists have focused on defining and protecting critical stream channel characteristics, but there is little information regarding the scale or spatial geometry of habitat that may be necessary for the speciesˈ long-term persistence. We investigated the influence of habitat patch size on the occurrence of bull trout by determining the presence or absence of fish in naturally fragmented watersheds of the Boise River basin in Idaho. We defined patches of potential habitat for bull trout as watersheds above 1,600 m elevation, a criterion based on the presumed restriction of local populations by stream temperature. We used logistic regression to investigate the possible influence of patch size as well as stream width and gradient on the occurrence of bull trout at reach, stream, and patch scales of analysis. Both stream width and patch size were significant in the models, but individual effects could not be clearly resolved because of collinearity. The predicted probability of occurrence based on patch size alone was less than 0.10 for patches smaller than about 1,000 ha and more than 0.50 for patches larger than about 2,500 ha. Our results support the hypothesis that area of available habitat influences the distribution of disjunct populations of bull trout. An area effect is consistent with the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theory, and our work suggests that larger-scale spatial processes may be important to the persistence of species like bull trout.},

We used classification trees and the patterns of association between known distributions and landscape characteristics to predict the likely distribution of bull trout in unsampled subwatersheds. Bull trout are more likely to occur and the populations are more likely to be strong in colder, higher-elevation, low- to mid-order watersheds with lower road densities. Our results show that bull trout remain widely distributed and occur in most of the subbasins representing the potential range. Some strong and relatively secure populations exist. In general, bull trout are better represented in the region as a whole than many other native species. Important declines in distribution and status are evident, although the extent of change is clouded by uncertainties in the historical distribution. Despite the broad distribution, much of the current range is poorly represented by strong or protected populations. The southern margins of the range are a particular concern and could be an important priority for conservation management. Continued habitat loss associated with disruptive land use practices threatens remaining bull trout populations. Even with no further habitat loss, existing fragmentation could contribute to continuing local extinctions aggravated by the expansion of introduced species and the effects of climate change.},

  abstract = {Past studies suggest that rates of woody plant resprouting following a “topkilling” disturbance relate to timing of disturbance because of temporal patterns of below-ground carbohydrate storage. Accordingly, we hypothesized that fire-return interval (1 or 2 years) and season of burn (late dormant or early growing season) would influence the change in resprout growth rate from one fire-free interval to the next (Δ growth rate) for broadleaf woody plants in a pine-grassland in Georgia, USA. Resprout growth rate during one fire-free interval strongly predicted growth rate during the following fire-free interval, presumably reflecting root biomass. Length of fire-free interval did not have a significant effect on mean Δ growth rate. Plants burned in the late dormant season (February–March) had a greater positive Δ growth rate than those burned in the early growing season (April–June), consistent with the presumption that root carbohydrates are depleted and thus limiting during spring growth. Plants with resprout growth rates above a certain level had zero or negative Δ growth rates, indicating an equilibrium of maximum resprout size under a given fire-return interval. This equilibrium, as well as relatively reduced resprout growth rate following growing season fires, provide insight into how historic lightning-initiated fires in the early growing season limited woody plant dominance and maintained the herb-dominated structure of pine-grassland communities. Results also indicate tradeoffs between applying prescribed fire at 1- versus 2-year intervals and in the dormant versus growing seasons with the goal of limiting woody vegetation.},

We examined interactions among heating, soil water content and soil texture on water repellency. Undisturbed, 305mm diameter cores were collected in the field from four soils commonly referred to as ash-cap, mixed ash-cap, no ash-cap and granitic soils. Three artificial burning treatments and a control (no heat) and two soil water contents were evaluated under laboratory conditions. Twenty water drops were placed on each soil layer starting at the surface and continuing at 10mm intervals to a depth of 70mm; and the times to infiltrate were recorded. The dry control treatment was more water repellent than the wet control treatment. The dry, low heat treatment was the most repellent, 10–20mm below the soil surface with mean water drop penetration times greater than 60s. Repellency decreased as the heating increased. In wet soils of the high heat treatment, a water repellent layer was generally detected 30–50mm below the soil surface. Presumably, hydrophobic substances were translocated along the temperature gradient which cooled at depth ({$<$}50mm) causing condensation on the soil particles. Water repellency after prescribed fire would probably be minimal because long heating times are not common.},

  abstract     = {In 2003, southern California experienced several large fires that burned thousands of hectares of wildlife habitats and conserved lands. To investigate the effects of these fires on the reptile and amphibian communities, we compared the results from prefire herpetofauna and vegetation sampling to two years of postfire sampling across 38 burned and 17 unburned plots. The sampling plots were spread over four vegetation types and four open space areas within San Diego County. Our capture results indicated that burned chaparral and coastal sage scrub plots lost herpetofaunal species diversity after the fires and displayed a significant shift in overall community structure. Shrub and tree cover at the burned plots, averaged across the second and third postfire years, had decreased by 53\% in chaparral and 75\% in coastal sage scrub. Additionally, postfire herpetofauna community structure at burned plots was more similar to that found in unburned grasslands. In grassland and woodland/riparian vegetation plots, where shrub and tree cover was not significantly affected by fires, we found no differences in the herpetofaunal species diversity or community composition. At the individual species level, Sceloporus occidentalis was the most abundant reptile in these areas both before and after the fires. We saw increases in the net capture rates for several lizard species, including Aspidoscelis tigris, Phrynosoma coronatum, and Uta stansburiana in burned chaparral plots and Aspidoscelis hyperythra and U. stansburiana in burned coastal sage scrub plots. The toad, Bufo boreas, was detected at significantly fewer burned plots in chaparral after the fires. Additionally, we documented decreases in the number of plots occupied by lizards (Elgaria multicarinata), salamanders (Batrachoseps major), and snakes (Coluber constrictor, Lampropeltis getula, Pituophis catenifer, and Masticophis lateralis) in coastal sage scrub and chaparral after the fires. We discuss the individual species results as they relate to such life-history traits as the susceptibility to initial mortality, the response to the altered postfire habitat, and shifts in the availability of potential prey. We foresee that a continued unnatural fire regime will result in a simplification of the southern California reptile and amphibian communities.},

  abstract     = {Wildfires are common in boreal forests around the globe and strongly influence ecosystem processes. However, North American forests support more high-intensity crown fires than Eurasia, where lower-intensity surface fires are common. These two types of fire can result in different net effects on climate as a consequence of their contrasting impacts on terrestrial albedo and carbon stocks. Here we use remote-sensing imagery, climate reanalysis data and forest inventories to evaluate differences in boreal fire dynamics between North America and Eurasia and their key drivers. Eurasian fires were less intense, destroyed less live vegetation, killed fewer trees and generated a smaller negative shortwave forcing. As fire weather conditions were similar across continents, we suggest that different fire dynamics between the two continents resulted from their dominant
tree species. In particular, species that have evolved to spread and be consumed by crown fires as part of their life cycle
dominate North American boreal forests. In contrast, tree species that have evolved to resist and suppress crown fires dominate Eurasian boreal forests.We conclude that species-level traits must be considered in global evaluations of the effects of fire on emissions and climate.},

  abstract     = {Fire in tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) is not as rare as once believed. Andean TMCFs sit immediately below highly flammable, high-altitude grasslands (Puna/Páramo) that suffer from recurrent anthropogenic fire. This treeline is a zone of climatic tension where substantial future warming is likely to force upward tree migrations, while increased fire presence and fire impacts are likely to force it downwards. TMCFs contain large carbon stocks in their peat soils and their loss through fire is a currently unaccounted for regional source of CO2. This study, conducted in the southern Peruvian Andes ({$>$}2800 m), documents differences in live tree biomass, fine root biomass, fallen and standing dead wood, and soil organic carbon in 4 paired-sample plots (burned versus control) following the severe ground fires that occurred during the 2005 Andean drought. Peat soils contributed the most to biomass burning emissions, with lower values corresponding to an 89\% mean stock difference compared to the controls (mean ± SE) (54.1 ± 22.3 vs. 5.8 ± 5.3 MgC ha−1). Contrastingly, carbon stocks from live standing trees differed by a non-significant 37\% lower value in the burned plots compared to the controls, largely compensated by vigorous resprouting (45.5 ± 17.4 vs. 69.2 ± 13.4 MgC ha−1). Both standing dead trees and fallen dead wood were significantly higher in the burned plots with a three-fold difference from the controls: dead Trees 45.2 ± 9.4 vs. 16.4 ± 4.4 MgC ha−1, and ca. a 2 fold difference for the fallen dead wood: 11.2 ± 5 vs. 6.7 ± 3.2 MgC ha−1 for the burned plots versus their controls. A preliminary estimate of the regional contribution of biomass burning emissions from Andean TMCFs for the period 2000–2008, resulted in mean carbon emission rates of 1.3 TgC yr−1 (max-min: 1.8–0.8 TgC yr−1). This value is in the same order of magnitude than South American annual fire emissions (300 TgC yr−1) suggesting the need for further research on Andean forest fires. On-going projects on the region are working on the promotion of landowner participation in TMCFs conservation through REDD+ mechanism. The heart of the proposed initiative is reforestation of degraded lands with green fire breaks enriched with economically valuable Andean plant species. The cultivation of these species may contribute to reduce deforestation pressure on the Amazonian cloud forest by providing an alternative income to local communities, at the same time that they prevent the spread of fire into Manu National Park and adjacent community-held forests, protecting forest and reducing CO2 emissions.},

The satellite observations of the Tropical-Rainfall-Measuring-Mission (TRMM), presented here, show that warm rain processes in convective tropical clouds infected by heavy smoke from forest fires are practically shut off. The tops of the smoke-infected clouds must exceed the freezing level, i.e., grow to altitudes colder than about ?10°C, for the clouds to start precipitating. In contrast, adjacent tropical clouds in the cleaner air precipitate most of their water before ever freezing. There are indications that rain suppression due to air pollution prevails also in the extra-tropics.},

Here, we describe the application of a commercial fire-management program being implemented over 28 000 km2 of savanna on Aboriginal lands in northern Australia. The project combines the reinstatement of Aboriginal traditional approaches to savanna fire management – in particular a strategic, early dry-season burning program – with a recently developed emissions accounting methodology for savanna burning. Over the first 7 years of implementation, the project has reduced emissions of accountable GHGs (methane, nitrous oxide) by 37.7\%, relative to the pre-project 10-year emissions baseline. In addition, the project is delivering social, biodiversity, and long-term biomass sequestration benefits. This methodological approach may have considerable potential for application in other fire-prone savanna settings.},

  abstract     = {Northern Australia comprises by far the most fire-prone-half of a fiery continent, where fire frequencies range from annual in the tropical savannas to periodic very-extensive fire events following above-rainfall conditions in the central Australian rangelands. As illustration of the challenges facing effective fire management in Australia’s 5.7 × 106 km2 rangelands, we examine the status of contemporary prescribed burning activities in the Northern Territory, a 1.4 × 106 km2, very sparsely settled (0.18 persons km−2) jurisdiction characterised by vast flammable landscapes, few barriers to fire-spread, predominantly anthropogenic ignitions, and limited institutional resources and capacity. Unsurprisingly, prescribed-fire management is shown to be restricted to specific locales. For more effective, landscape-scale fire management, potential solutions include engagement with dispersed remote communities and incorporation of Indigenous Ranger Groups into the fire-management network, and building on the success of savanna-burning greenhouse gas emission projects as an example for incentivising landscape fire and emergency management services generally. Recently, significant steps have been taken towards implementing formal regional fire-management planning processes involving inclusive community-stakeholder engagement, and the setting of clearly defined time-constrained objectives and targets.},

The goal of the volume is twofold: (1) to provide cultural resource/archaeological professionals and policy makers with a primer on fuels, fire behavior, and fire effects to enable them to work more effectively with the fire management community to protect resources during fuels treatment and restoration projects and wildfire suppression activities; and (2) to provide fire and land management professionals and policy makers with a greater understanding of the value of cultural resource protection and the methods available to evaluate and mitigate risks to CR. The synthesis provides a conceptual fire effects framework for planning, managing, and modeling fire effects (chapter1) and a primer on fire and fuel processes and fire effects prediction modeling (chapter 2). A synthesis of the effects of fire on various cultural resource materials is provided for ceramics (chapter 3), lithics (chapter 4), rock art (chapter 5), historic-period artifacts/materials (chapter 6), and below-ground features (chapter 7). Chapter 8 discusses the importance of cultural landscapes to indigenous peoples and emphasizes the need to actively involve native people in the development of collaborative management plans. The use and practical implications of this synthesis are the subject of the final chapter (chapter 9).},

A 12-h integrated intensive sampling of biomass burning aerosol in the fine and coarse modes was conducted on 2–20 June 2003 in Gwangju, Korea. The collected samples were analyzed for concentrations of mass, ionic, elemental, and carbonaceous species. Average concentrations of fine and coarse mass were measured to be 67.9 and 18.7~μg m−3 during the biomass burning period, 41.9 and 18.8~μg m−3 during the haze period, and 35.6 and 13.3~μg m−3 during the normal period, respectively. An exceptionally high PM2.5 concentration of 110.3~μg m−3 with a PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 0.79 was observed on 6 June 2003 during the biomass burning period. The potassium ratio method was used to identify biomass burning samples. The average ratio of potassium in the fine mode to the coarse mode (FK/CK) was 23.8 during the biomass burning period, 6.0 during the haze period, and 4.7 during the normal period, respectively. A FK/CK ratio above 9.2 was considered a criterion for biomass burning event in this study. Particulate matter from the open field burning of agricultural waste has an adverse impact on visibility, human health, and regional air quality.},

  abstract = {A central goal in ecology is to predict population dynamics from demographic information. Based on the asymptotic population growth rate λ, calculated from a projection matrix model as a descriptor of the population dynamics, we analyze published data of 49 species of birds to determine how λ is influenced by variation in different demographic traits. Across species, the mean elasticity of the adult survival rate was significantly larger than the mean elasticity of the fecundity rate. The contribution of the fecundity rate to the population growth rate increased with increasing clutch size and decreasing adult survival rate, while the greatest contribution of adult survival rate occurred among long-lived species that matured late and laid few eggs. This represents a continuum from “highly reproductive species” at one end to “survivor species” at the other end. In addition, a high contribution of adult survival rate was found in some relatively long-lived species with early age at maturity (and a large clutch size) which was assumed to represent a bet-hedging strategy, i.e., producing a large number of offspring in some occasional good years. In a retrospective analysis, interspecific differences in the effects of actual temporal variation in adult survival rate and fecundity rate on the variability of λ were analyzed. These effects are expected to be large when the variance or the sensitivity of the trait is large. Because there was a negative relationship among species, both for the adult survival rate and the fecundity rate between the variability and the sensitivity of the trait, contribution of a trait to the variance in λ decreased with sensitivity. Similarly, within species, less temporal variation was found in traits with high elasticities than in traits with less contribution to λ. In some species, covariance among matrix elements also influenced the contribution of a demographic trait to λ. Monitoring schemes of bird demography should be designed in such a way that temporal variances and covariances among demographic traits can be estimated. Furthermore, it is important in such schemes to include data from a combination of traits that either have large sensitivities or high temporal variation.},

  abstract = {Fire can induce long-lived changes to land-surface albedo, an important aspect of the Earth\&rsquo;s energy budget, but the temporal evolution of these anomalies is poorly understood. Due to the widespread presence of fire in Africa, this represents uncertainty in the continental energy budget, which has important implications for regional climate and hydrologic cycling. In this study, we present the first object-based accounting of albedo anomalies induced by larger (\&gt;1 km2) individual wildfires in sub-Saharan Africa. We group spatially contiguous wildfire pixels into fire objects and track the albedo anomaly for five years after the burn. We find that albedo anomalies all have the same general temporal signature: An immediate, brief period of darkening followed by persistent brightening. The strongest brightening is found in the Kalahari region while more intense and long-lived initial darkening is found in the Sahel region. The average southern hemisphere albedo anomaly is +1.50 \&times; 10\&minus;3 in the year following wildfire, representing a statistically significant negative surface energy balance forcing on a continental scale. This study challenges an existing paradigm surrounding the physical effects of fire on the landscape. Our results suggest that models of albedo that assume a darkening and recovery to baseline are overly simplistic in almost all circumstances. Furthermore, the presumption that immediate darkening is the only meaningful effect on albedo is incorrect for the majority of the African continent.},

Our study aimed at producing a first characterization of post-fire Coleoptera assemblages of black spruce forests of eastern North America. For two years, we sampled Coleoptera using flight-interception traps in burned stands of contrasting age and structure in a 5097-ha wildfire and in neighbouring unburned mature stands. More than 40 species were exclusively captured in burned stands. Time elapsed since fire and proximity of unburned forests were the most significant parameters affecting Coleoptera assemblages. Stand age and structure had limited effects on assemblage structure; the Scolytid Polygraphus rufipennis Kirby was the only common species to clearly favor older stands. Fire-associated Coleoptera assemblages found in our study area were clearly distinct from those found in similar unburned stands; we should thus be conservative in our management approach concerning recently burned stands.},

  abstract     = {Extreme fire events, also referred to as “megafires,” are not uncommon events on a global scale; they tend to happen a steady frequency in different parts of the world, although, at a local or regional scale, they constitute unique and severe fire episodes. Even if there is not a complete agreement on the term, megafires often refers to those fire events that cause catastrophic damages in terms of human casualties, economic losses, or both. In this article we analyze some of the most damaging fire episodes in Europe in the last decades. Our analysis relates the events to existing conditions in terms of number of fires and burnt areas in the countries and regions where they occurred, showing that these large fire episodes do not follow the general trend of those variables and constitute outstanding critical events. Megafires are characterized on the basis of the meteorological and fire danger conditions prior to the event and those under which they develop. Impact is assessed in terms of total burnt area, estimates of economic losses, if available, and number of human casualties caused by the megafire event. We analyze fire-fighting means available for the extinction of each megafire, as reported in the annual reports of the European Commission, to determine if fire spread might have been related to lack of available means for initial control and extinction. All countries where the reported megafires took place are in fire prone areas where active fire campaigns take place every year. Our results determine that megafires are critical events that stand out with respect to the average conditions in the respective countries; in all cases, the impact of the fires set a record damage in the country or region where the megafire event took place. It is shown that, in the cases under study, megafires were driven by critical weather conditions that lead to a concentration of numerous large fires in time and space (fire clusters). It is shown that these megafire events occurred independently of the large expenditures in forest fire fighting means and increased preparedness in the countries where they took place. The simultaneity in fire ignitions and the rapid fire spread prevented efficient initial fire attacks. Therefore, megafires occur independently of the available fire means in the countries and are set under control only when the weather conditions improve and facilitate fire fighting. Our analysis supports a series of recommendations that are seek to promote fire-prevention oriented forest management and increase awareness on potential extreme fire events to prevent the occurrence of megafires in Mediterranean regions.},

  abstract     = {ContextConservation of grassland vertebrates requires a mechanistic understanding of the effects of landscape heterogeneity on habitat selection and demographic performance.ObjectivesOur goal was to investigate the effects of rangeland management on resource selection and nest survival of upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda).MethodsWe conducted our project at Konza Prairie, a Long-Term Ecological Research site. The station has 60 experimental units with replicated grazing and fire treatments that create a heterogeneous landscape of different habitat patches. We radio-tracked sandpipers for two breeding seasons (2003–2004, n = 37 birds) and monitored sandpiper nests for eight seasons (2001–2008, n = 246 nests). We used resource utilization functions to examine resource selection with respect to five landscape features.ResultsHome ranges of sandpipers were large in contiguous prairie (𝑥¯=8.4km2x¯=8.4km2\textbackslash bar\{x\} = 8.4\textbackslash;\{\textbackslash text\{km\}\}\^\{ 2\}) and explain area-sensitive occurrence in fragmented prairie. Upland sandpipers selected grazed and burned sites with short vegetation within their home range. In contrast, nest site selection was influenced by fire frequency and birds selected infrequently burned sites with greater vegetative structure. Settlement decisions affected fitness because nest survival was low in burned and grazed sites (0.068), but higher in unburned and ungrazed sites (0.201–0.247).ConclusionsOur results raise concerns for conservation because private rangelands managed for livestock production are often homogeneous landscapes with heavy grazing and frequent fires. Rotational grazing and fire could be used to restore heterogeneity to grasslands but the duration of rotation, patch size, and optimal configuration require further investigation.},

  abstract     = {In the next decades, the influence of wildfires in controlling the cycling and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) globally and in the western U.S. is expected to grow. While the impact of fires on bulk SOM has been extensively studied, the extent at which heating of soil affects the soluble component of SOM remains unclear. Here we investigated the thermal transformations of water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) by examining the changes in the distribution of carbon (C) functional groups in WEOM from soils heated at low and intermediate temperatures. WEOM ({$<$}0.7 µm particle size) was extracted from topsoils (0–5 cm depth) of five soil series formed from a nonglaciated granitic bedrock and sampled along a Sierra Nevada climosequence. Soils were heated in a muffle furnace at 150°C, 250°C, and 350°C for 1 h. The extracted solution was analyzed for WEOM aromaticity, mean molecular weight, organic C (OC) concentration, and major structural components by employing optical spectrophotometry and liquid-state 1H-NMR spectroscopy. At 150°C and 250°C, OC concentrations increased relative to the thermally unaltered samples, with losses of oxygenated functional C groups and enrichment of aliphatic C structures observed at 250°C. Conversely, OC concentration and mean molecular weight decreased as heating increased from 250°C to 350°C, whereas WEOC became more enriched in aromatic C structures. Our results suggest that low and intermediate fire intensities significantly alter the nature of dissolved organic matter exported from soils to rivers in the Sierra Nevada and beyond.},

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION During the last three decades, biodiversity conservation has emerged as a central focus of environmental concern in many regions of the world (Sarkar 2005). As a result, large-scale efforts are being devoted to devising systematic protocols for conservation, sometimes involving computational efforts unprecedented in ecology (Margules and Pressey 2000). These efforts presume that a sufficiently precise concept of biodiversity is at hand. Some philosophical attention has also been focused on elaborating an adequate normative basis for conservation. These attempted normative justifications for biodiversity conservation also depend on what is meant by biodiversity. Yet, “biodiversity” remains a contested term.The term “biodiversity” was first used in 1986 as a contraction for “biological diversity” by Walter G. Rosen while planning for a (U.S.) National Forum on Biodiversity (Takacs 1996). Subsequently, temporarily mutated as “BioDiversity,” it was used as the title for the proceedings from that meeting (Wilson 1988). No attempt was made to define the term precisely, even as its use spread - the chronology in Table 21.1 includes the most salient episodes. Conservation biology also emerged as a distinct interdisciplinary research area during the 1980s with its central aim the protection of biodiversity (Takacs 1996, Sarkar 2002, 2005).},

  abstract = {For the last 23 years, low-severity prescribed fire has been used to decrease shade and fire tolerant tree species, increase oak (Quercus spp.), and increase herbaceous plant diversity in the East Woods of The Morton Arboretum, Lisle, Illinois, USA. The impacts of these fires on the belowground ecosystem have yet to be measured. Soil (0 to 10 cm) and litter samples were collected 12, 19, and 24 months following the most recent fire on 40 plots in burned and un-burned control areas. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured and compared with vegetation composition and structure from these same plots. Compared to un-burned controls, burn plots had greater canopy openness, greater herbaceous richness, and a lower spring/summer herbaceous ratio. Burned plots had higher soil moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca2 +, Mg2 +, K+, Na+, NO3−, total N, particulate organic matter (POM), total organic C, and potential N mineralization. Soil microbial biomass and respiration, texture, color, aggregate stability, and hydrophobicity were not different in burned compared to un-burned plots. Indices of litter and soil invertebrate diversity were also not affected by prescribed fire. Three stepwise least squares models predicted woody richness, herbaceous richness, and spring/summer herbs with aspect, litter invertebrate richness, and soil factors (pH, potential N mineralization, C/N ratio, Mg2+, Bray P, and soil invertebrate Simpson index). These results confirm others showing prescribed fire to increase soil nutrient availability. Forest structural changes with fire appear correlated with soil nutrient availability. Decreased soil C, nutrient retention, invertebrate diversity, or increased hydrophobicity and the presence of exotic plants is often observed with high-severity fire; but, these negative impacts do not appear to be present with these long-term, low-severity fires.},

  abstract     = {Successional changes in the potential for fire propagation were analyzed in Vaccinium myrtillus type forests in northern Sweden through fuel sampling and fire simulations in stands with different time since the last fire, and ignition tests in early successional and mature vegetation. Within three decades, fine fuel on the ground reached 0.6 to 0.9 kg⋅m–2 and was thereafter fairly constant at this level. In the youngest stands this fuel consisted mainly of litter from the tree canopy, whereas in the oldest stands, pleurocarpous mosses made up the majority of the load. The expansion of pleurocarpous mosses from around year 20 resulted in a shift towards a deeper and less compact fuel bed. Simulations using the Rothermel fire spread model predicted no or minimal fire spread in stands younger than 25 years, and this was corroborated by a number of unsuccessful ignitions on recently burnt sites. We suggest three phases in postfire succession with respect to fire propagation and surface fire intensity: (1) up to about 20 years after fire, no or marginal fire spread; (2) between years 20 and 50 a progressive rise in potential fire intensity; (3) from around year 50 a steady state in potential fire intensity. By setting a limit for the shortest possible fire intervals, this pattern of fuel accumulation might have a significant effect on fire frequencies in the landscape.},

  abstract     = {In many regions of the world, fires are an important and highly variable source of air pollutant emissions, and they thus constitute a significant if not dominant factor controlling the interannual variability of the atmospheric composition. This paper describes the 41-year inventory of vegetation fire emissions constructed for the Reanalysis of the Tropospheric chemical composition over the past 40 years project (RETRO), a global modeling study to investigate the trends and variability of tropospheric ozone and other air pollutants over the past decades. It is the first attempt to construct a global emissions data set with monthly time resolution over such a long period. The inventory is based on a literature review, on estimates from different satellite products, and on a numerical model with a semiphysical approach to simulate fire occurrence and fire spread. Burned areas, carbon consumption, and total carbon release are estimated for 13 continental-scale regions, including explicit treatment of some major burning events such as Indonesia in 1997 and 1998. Global carbon emissions from this inventory range from 1410 to 3140 Tg C/a with the minimum and maximum occurring in 1974 and 1992, respectively (mean of 2078 Tg C/a). Emissions of other species are also reported (mean CO of 330 Tg/a, NOx of 4.6 Tg N/a, CH2O of 3.9 Tg/a, CH4 of 15.4 Tg/a, BC of 2.2 Tg/a, OC of 17.6 Tg/a, SO2 of 2.2 Tg/a). The uncertainties of these estimates remain high even for later years where satellite data products are available. Future versions of this inventory may benefit from ongoing analysis of burned areas from satellite data going back to 1982.},

  abstract     = {Summary The provisioning of ecosystem services to society is increasingly under pressure from global change. Changing disturbance regimes are of particular concern in this context due to their high potential impact on ecosystem structure, function and composition. Resilience-based stewardship is advocated to address these changes in ecosystem management, but its operational implementation has remained challenging. We review observed and expected changes in disturbance regimes and their potential impacts on provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services, concentrating on temperate and boreal forests. Subsequently, we focus on resilience as a powerful concept to quantify and address these changes and their impacts, and present an approach towards its operational application using established methods from disturbance ecology. We suggest using the range of variability concept ? characterizing and bounding the long-term behaviour of ecosystems ? to locate and delineate the basins of attraction of a system. System recovery in relation to its range of variability can be used to measure resilience of ecosystems, allowing inferences on both engineering resilience (recovery rate) and monitoring for regime shifts (directionality of recovery trajectory). It is important to consider the dynamic nature of these properties in ecosystem analysis and management decision-making, as both disturbance processes and mechanisms of resilience will be subject to changes in the future. Furthermore, because ecosystem services are at the interface between natural and human systems, the social dimension of resilience (social adaptive capacity and range of variability) requires consideration in responding to changing disturbance regimes in forests. Synthesis and applications. Based on examples from temperate and boreal forests we synthesize principles and pathways for fostering resilience to changing disturbance regimes in ecosystem management. We conclude that future work should focus on testing and implementing these pathways in different contexts to make ecosystem services provisioning more robust to changing disturbance regimes and advance our understanding of how to cope with change and uncertainty in ecosystem management.},

  abstract     = {Summary Rationale Pyrogenic savannas with a tree-grassland ?matrix? experience frequent fires (i.e. every 1-3 years). Aboveground responses to frequent fires have been well-studied, but responses of fungal litter decomposers, which directly affect fuels, remain poorly known. We hypothesized that each fire reorganizes below-ground communities and slows litter decomposition, thereby influencing savanna fuel dynamics. Methods In a pine savanna, we established patches near and away from pines that were either burned or unburned in that year. Within patches, we assessed fungal communities and microbial decomposition of newly deposited litter. Soil variables and plant communities were also assessed as proximate drivers of fungal communities. Results Fungal communities, but not soil variables or vegetation, differed substantially between burned and unburned patches. Saprotrophic fungi dominated in unburned patches but decreased in richness and relative abundance after fire. Differences in fungal communities with fire were greater in litter than soils, but unaffected by pine proximity. Litter decomposed more slowly in burned than unburned patches. Conclusions Fires drive shifts between fire-adapted and sensitive fungal taxa in pine savannas. Slower fuel decomposition in accordance with saprotroph declines should enhance fuel accumulation and could impact future fire characteristics. Thus, fire-reorganization of fungal communities may enhance persistence of these fire-adapted ecosystems. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

This study used extensive pre- and postfire data to assess whether wildfire leads to hypothesized declines in native westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi and bull trout Salvelinus confluentus populations along with increases in the prevalence and abundance of nonnative brook trout S. fontinalis. Postfire cutthroat trout density was negatively correlated with the proportion of basin area that burned at moderate to high severity, but the declines in density after fires were less pronounced for bull trout and brook trout. Recovery of cutthroat trout was generally rapid in severely affected reaches. Contrary to expectation, there was no evidence of a marked increase in abundance or invasion by brook trout after wildfire. Brook trout exhibited the most severe declines in debris flow–affected reaches among all species and exhibited less recovery in severely burned reaches than did cutthroat trout. Increased stream temperature was the most significant habitat change that followed wildfire, the mean maximum water temperature during summer months increasing by 2–6◦C in severely burned reaches. In contrast, burned area percentage was unrelated to large woody debris density, the percentage of surface fines, substrate diversity, or the percentage of pool habitat. The characteristically high variability in fish and habitat responses to wildfire will continue to pose a challenge for the understanding and management of fire in aquatic ecosystems.},

We report results from an experiment designed to separate and test the current leading hypotheses of tree mortality. We show that piñon pine (Pinus edulis) trees can die of both hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, and that during drought, the loss of conductivity and carbohydrate reserves can also co-occur. Hydraulic constraints on plant carbohydrate use determined survival time: turgor loss in the phloem limited access to carbohydrate reserves, but hydraulic control of respiration prolonged survival. Our data also demonstrate that hydraulic failure may be associated with loss of adequate tissue carbohydrate content required for osmoregulation, which then promotes failure to maintain hydraulic integrity.},

  abstract     = {Bushfires in southeastern Australia are a serious environmental problem, and consistently cause loss of life and damage to property and other assets. Understanding synoptic processes that can lead to dangerous fire weather conditions throughout the region is therefore an important undertaking aimed at improving community safety, protection of assets, and fire suppression tactics and strategies. In southeastern Australia severe fire weather is often associated with dry cool changes or coastally modified cold fronts. Less well known, however, are synoptic events that can occur in connection with the topography of the region, such as crossmountain flows and foehn-like winds, which can also lead to abrupt changes in fire weather variables that ultimately result in locally elevated fire danger. This paper focuses on foehn-like occurrences over the southeastern mainland, which are characterized by warm, dry winds on the lee side of the Australian Alps. The characteristics of a number of foehn-like occurrences are analyzed based on observational data and the predictions of a numerical weather model. The analyses confirm the existence of a foehn effect over parts of southeastern Australia and suggest that its occurrence is primarily due to the partial orographic blocking of relatively moist low-level air and the subsidence of drier upper-level air in the lee of the mountains. The regions prone to foehn occurrence, the influence of the foehn on fire weather variables, and the connection between the foehn and mountain waves are also discussed.},

Beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax) is a basketry plant used by Native Americans and is reportedly declining in traditional gathering sites. Many low-elevation beargrass sites on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington were maintained as savannas and wetland prairies through anthropogenic burning prior to European settlement. This study measures short-term (1 and 2 y) effects of reintroducing prescribed burning (both low and high severity) and manual clearing on beargrass growth and reproductive success—flowering, vegetative reproduction, and seedling establishment. High-severity fire led to a significant increase in beargrass seedling establishment and vegetative reproduction over two years but a decline in beargrass cover. Low-severity fire also decreased beargrass cover, but did not significantly affect shoot production or seedling establishment. In areas where vegetation and coarse woody debris were manually cleared, beargrass cover decreased, while shoot production and flowering increased. Neither low-severity fires nor clearing plots affected beargrass seedling establishment. Results indicate that fire is a useful tool for enhancing low-elevation beargrass populations in this region.},

We employed four sampling methods over 3 y and caught 11,215 arthropods of 551 species. Species had varied and often negatively correlated short vs. long-term responses to burning. In the years savannas were burned, species richness and abundance of arthropods, especially Homoptera and Lepidoptera, were reduced and species compositions were sometimes more similar. However, despite its major effect on vegetation, frequency of burning did not affect arthropod abundance and species richness, but sometimes caused savannas to be similar in species or taxonomic order composition. The Shannon diversity index was unaffected by burning. On the whole, prescribed burns necessary to maintain grasslands and savannas do not appear to be harmful to, or to greatly impact, the arthropod fauna.},

  abstract     = {Ecohydrological linkages between phosphorus (P) production, stream algae, benthic invertebrate, and fish communities were studied for 4 years after severe wildfire in the Rocky Mountains (Alberta, Canada). Mean concentrations of all forms of P (soluble reactive, total dissolved, particulate, and total) were 2 to 13 times greater in burned and post-fire salvage-logged streams than in unburned streams (p {$<$} 0.001). Post-disturbance recovery of P was slow with differences in P-discharge relationships still evident 5 years after the fire (p {$<$} 0.001). Coupled P and sediment interactions were likely responsible for slow recovery of P regimes in fire-disturbed watersheds. P loading was associated with strong ecological responses in stream biota. Annual algal productivity was 5 to 71 times greater in streams within burned watersheds than in reference watersheds and persisted for 5 years after the fire (p {$<$} 0.001). Elevated algal production was associated with strong differences in benthic invertebrate community structure, including greater invertebrate densities, biomass, species diversity, and shifts in species composition. Monotonic shifts in invertebrate stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios indicated increased consumption of autochthonous food sources and effects on energy pathways for invertebrates from fire-affected streams. Wildfire-related changes at lower trophic lead to increases in size (weight and length) and growth rate (weight : age ratios) of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). This cascading series of effects of wildfire on stream productivity (primary production, secondary invertebrate consumers, and fish) may be long-lived legacies of wildfire because of the slow recovery of P regimes.

  abstract     = {Aim We tested the hypothesis that exclusion from fire and cattle is responsible for the increase in tree cover in open savanna vegetation. Location Four plots in open savanna vegetation from the Calabozo region in central Venezuela were studied. Plot A was located in a Biological Station (EBL) that was excluded from fire and cattle between 1961 and 1991, with only two burning events in 1964 and 1968. The other plots (B, C, D) were located within 2?km distance from A, in neighbouring farms with soils similar to those in A but under various regimes of land use and fire frequency. Methods We measured the cover of isolated trees, small tree groups and groves of each plot in 1960 and 1977 using geographic information system (GIS) and digitalized aerial photographs. Additionally, the plots were located in the field and the open grassland was sampled in 1995 for species composition and density of stems above 20?cm height. Information on land use was obtained surveying people at the farms. Results There was an increase in the woody component of all plots during the 17-year interval (1960?1977). Total woody cover in the four plots as a whole increased from 4.5\% to 17.9\%. All three components measured, groves, tree groups and isolated trees, increased despite differences in land use and fire frequency between plots. Contrary to our expectations, the field survey performed in 1995 showed that fire-sensitive species were abundant in the open savanna in plots B, C and D, which were not excluded. Plot B, with the most intense agricultural use showed the highest rate of woody increase, and plot C, under extensive cattle ranching, was second. The results also showed that woody cover increased by aggregation from single trees and small tree groups into groves. As a consequence of these changes, savanna physiognomy changed from open to dense savanna parkland with a woody cover reaching over 25\% in one of the four plots. Conclusions The results agree with other reported increases in woody cover in savannas under exclusion or with annual fires during the same time period in Africa (Dauget \& Menaut, 1992). Our results support evidence from previous studies showing that fire and grazing are only part of a complex system of interacting factors affecting the structure of savanna communities.},

  abstract     = {A series of nine fire experiments was conducted on a large-scale bench with an inclinable plate to study the effects of a slope on fire spread. The temperature and total and radiant heat flux densities were measured at the top of the fuel bed during the upslope fire spread in still air. Measurements were recorded at five different locations ahead of the fire front. The effects of the slope on the flame topology, fire dynamics, and heat transfers ahead of the fire front were observed. The thermal measurements and image analyses showed a change in the fire spread regime and its related behavior with an increase in the slope. This was observed through an elongation of the flame and its contact surface over the upper part of the fuel bed. When the slope increased, the fire topology changed from a U-shape to a V-shape, and the radiationdominated thermal environment ahead of the flame front was progressively turned into a mixed convective-radiative one, in which convection finally dominated for steep slope configurations. For fire spreading across a 30° slope, this increase in the curvature of the fire front (V-shape) is associated with the appearance of fire whirls rolling along the flanks of the fire front, which indicates significant changes in the fluid mechanics and heat transfers. The span of the heat transfer increased and a significant amount of energy impinged 1 or 2 m ahead of the flame front because of the flame tilt (radiation) and hot gas flow (convection). The measurements also indicated a greater amount of energy impinging in the center of the fuel bed than at the edge. This study shows the importance of investigating the fluid mechanics of fire in future wildfire researches.},

A pioneering combination of heat flux measurements and a large-scale particle image velocimetry system is presented. Three different fuel loads and two slopes (0° and 30°) are investigated. The results provide new insights into the fluid mechanics of fire spread, elucidating the air entrained flow motion generated by the fire as a function of the fuel load and slope in particular. For horizontal fires, increases in the vertical velocities and the size of the mixing layer, which is formed by the elevation of hot gases in the atmosphere, are observed with increasing fuel load. The air ahead of the fire is aspired far from the fire, suggesting convective cooling of the unburned vegetation. For 30°-upslope fires, the measurements show a convective heat transfer generated by hot gases advancing towards the unburned vegetation, which is supported by the elongation of the fire head. The experimental technique presented in this study is, therefore, effective for extracting valuable data for fire modeling.},

  abstract     = {High-severity wildfires, which can homogenize floral communities, are becoming more common relative to historic mixedseverity fire regimes in the Northern Rockies of the U.S. High-severity wildfire could negatively affect bumble bees, which are typically diet generalists, if floral species of inadequate pollen quality dominate the landscape post-burn. High-severity wildfires often require more time to return to pre-burn vegetation composition, and thus, effects of high-severity burns may persist past initial impacts. We investigated how wildfire severity (mixed- vs. high-severity) and time-since-burn affected available floral pollen quality, corbicular pollen quality, and bumble bee nutrition using percent nitrogen as a proxy for pollen quality and bumble bee nutrition. We found that community-weighted mean floral pollen nitrogen, corbicular pollen nitrogen, and bumble bee nitrogen were greater on average by 0.82\%N, 0.60\%N, and 1.16\%N, respectively, in mixed-severity burns. This pattern of enhanced floral pollen nitrogen in mixed-severity burns was likely driven by the floral community, as community-weighted mean floral pollen percent nitrogen explained 87.4\% of deviance in floral community composition. Only bee percent nitrogen varied with time-since-burn, increasing by 0.33\%N per year. If these patterns persist across systems, our findings suggest that although wildfire is an essential ecosystem process, there are negative early successional impacts of high-severity wildfires on bumble bees and potentially on other pollen-dependent organisms via reductions in available pollen quality and nutrition. This work examines a previously unexplored pathway for how disturbances can influence native bee success via altering the nutritional landscape of pollen.},

  abstract     = {We investigated effects of fire frequency, seasonal timing, and plant community on patchiness and intensity of prescribed fires in subtropical savannas in the Long Pine Key region of Everglades National Park, Florida (U.S.A.). We measured patchiness and intensity in different plant communities along elevation gradients in “fire blocks.” These blocks were prescribed burned at varying times during the lightning season and at different frequencies between 1995 and 2000. Fire frequency, seasonal timing, and plant community all influenced the patchiness and intensity of prescribed fires. Fires were less patchy and more intense, probably because of drier conditions and pyrogenic fuels, in higher elevation plant communities (e.g., high pine savannas) than in lower elevation communities (e.g., long-hydroperiod prairies). In all plant communities fires became increasingly patchy and less intense as the wet season progressed and moisture accumulated in fuels. Frequent prescribed fire resulted in increased patchiness but a wider range of intensities; higher intensities appeared to result from regrowth of more flammable vegetation. Our study suggests that frequent early lightning season prescribed fires produce a wider range of post-fire conditions than less frequent late lightning season prescribed fires. Our study also suggests that natural early lightning season fires readily carried through pine savannas and short-hydroperiod prairies, but lower elevation long-hydroperiod prairies functioned as firebreaks. Natural fires probably crossed these firebreaks only during drier years, potentially producing large landscape-level fires. Knowledge of how patchily and intensely fires burn across a savanna landscape should be useful for developing landscape-level fire management.},

No charred or scorched wood was associated with scars of trees exposed to single fires; wood exposed by scars from the 1995 fire was charred by the 1997 fire. Consistent with the compartmentalization process, discoloration and whiterot occurred within compartment boundaries of wood present at the time of wounding.

  abstract     = {Wildfires burn extensive forest areas around the world each year. In many locations, fire-prone forest catchments are utilised for the supply of potable water to small communities up to large cities. Following wildfire, increased erosion rates and changes to runoff generation and pollutant sources may greatly increase fluxes of sediment, nutrients and other water quality constituents, potentially contaminating water supplies. Most research to date has focused on suspended sediment exports and concentrations after wildfire. Reported first year post-fire suspended sediment exports varied from 0.017 to 50 t haÀ1 yearÀ1 across a large range of catchment sizes (0.021–1655 km2). This represented an estimated increase of 1–1459 times unburned exports. Maximum reported concentrations of total suspended solids in streams for the first year after fire ranged from 11 to \$500,000 mg LÀ1. Similarly, there was a large range in first year post-fire stream exports of total N (1.1–27 kg haÀ1 yearÀ1) and total P (0.03–3.2 kg haÀ1 yearÀ1), representing a multiple change of 0.3–431 times unburned, while NOÀ3 exports of 0.04–13.0 kg haÀ1 yearÀ1 (3–250 times unburned) have been reported. NO3À, NO2À, and NH3/NHþ4 concentrations in streams and lakes or reservoirs may increase after wildfire but appear to present a generally low risk of exceeding drinking water guidelines. Few studies have examined post-fire exports of trace elements. The limited observations of trace element concentrations in streams after wildfire found high levels (well over guidelines) of Fe, Mn, As, Cr, Al, Ba, and Pb, which were associated with highly elevated sediment concentrations. In contrast, Cu, Zn, and Hg were below or only slightly above guideline values. Elevated Na+, ClÀ and SO42À solute yields have been recorded soon after fire, while reports of concentrations of these constituents were mostly confined to coniferous forest areas in North America, where maximum sampled values were well below recommended limits. Likewise, reported wildfire effects on dissolved organic carbon were generally minor and elevated concentrations largely reflected background conditions. Available cyanide concentrations in small streams may approach levels of concern soon after fire, but increases are likely to be of short duration. Post-fire concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in streams have been found to increase but remained within the recommended limit. Large increases in exports and concentrations of some constituents after wildfire indicate the potential for impacts on water supply from forest catchments. In response, various water treatment measures may be required and in the absence of adequate treatment facilities or alternative sources, water supplies may be vulnerable to disruption.},

  abstract     = {Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is the most widespread tree species in North America and has supported a unique ecosystem for tens of thousands of years, yet is currently threatened by dramatic loss and possible local extinctions. While multiple factors such as climate change and fire suppression are thought to contribute to aspen’s decline, increased browsing by elk (Cervus elaphus), which have experienced dramatic population increases in the last ∼80years, may severely inhibit aspen growth and regeneration. Fires are known to favor aspen recovery, but in the last several decades the spatial scale and intensity of wildfires has greatly increased, with poorly understood ramifications for aspen growth. Here, focusing on the 2000 Cerro Grande fire in central New Mexico – one of the earliest fires described as a “mega-fire” - we use three methods to examine the impact of elk browsing on aspen regeneration after a mega-fire. First, we use an exclosure experiment to show that aspen growing in the absence of elk were 3× taller than trees growing in the presence of elk. Further, aspen that were both protected from elk and experienced burning were 8.5× taller than unburned trees growing in the presence of elk, suggesting that the combination of release from herbivores and stimulation from fire creates the largest aspen growth rates. Second, using surveys at the landscape level, we found a correlation between elk browsing intensity and aspen height, such that where elk browsing was highest, aspen were shortest. This relationship between elk browsing intensity and aspen height was stronger in burned (r=−0.53) compared to unburned (r=−0.24) areas. Third, in conjunction with the landscape-level surveys, we identified possible natural refugia, microsites containing downed logs, shrubs etc. that may inhibit elk browsing by physically blocking aspen from elk or by impeding elk’s ability to move through the forest patch. We did not find any consistent patterns between refuge elements and aspen size or canopy cover suggesting that natural refugia are not aiding in aspen recruitment and that all young aspen were susceptible to browsing. In much of their normal range, aspen are not growing to large size classes, which threatens the future of this iconic species and calls into question the ability of ecosystems to recover from mega-fires. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple interacting factors (i.e. fire and increased elk browsing) when considering aspen management and regeneration.},

In this study, we investigated soil fungal and bacterial communities and biogeochemical responses of severely burned ‘‘red” soil and less severely burned ‘‘black” soil from a burned forest on the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Oregon. Specifically, we examined the effects of burn severity on soil nutrients and microbial communities for 1–4 years after wildfire. Soil nutrients were significantly reduced in red soils. Soil fungi and bacteria, assessed with molecular methods, steadily colonized both burn severities and soil biodiversity increased throughout the study showing that microbial communities seem to have the capacity to quickly adjust to extreme disturbances. Although richness did not vary by soil type, the fungal and bacterial community compositions varied with burn severity. This difference was greatest in the early time points following the fire and decreased with time. However, nutrient-limited conditions of red soils were detected for four years after the wildfire and raise concern about soil productivity at these sites.},

The response on social media was fantastic, leading to numerous recommendations of women leaders in fire science that had been inadvertently missed in the first editorial.

  abstract     = {Stand-replacing fires influence soil nitrogen availability and microbial community composition, which may in turn mediate post-fire successional dynamics and nutrient cycling. However, fires create patchiness at both local and landscape scales and do not result in consistent patterns of ecological dynamics. The objectives of this study were to (1) quantify the spatial structure of microbial communities in forest stands recently affected by stand-replacing fire and (2) determine whether microbial variables aid predictions of in situ net nitrogen mineralization rates in recently burned stands. The study was conducted in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir (Picea engelmannii/Abies lasiocarpa) forest stands that burned during summer 2000 in Greater Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA). Using a fully probabilistic spatial process model and Bayesian kriging, the spatial structure of microbial lipid abundance and fungi-to-bacteria ratios were found to be spatially structured within plots two years following fire (for most plots, autocorrelation range varied from 1.5 to 10.5 m). Congruence of spatial patterns among microbial variables, in situ net N mineralization, and cover variables was evident. Stepwise regression resulted in significant models of in situ net N mineralization and included variables describing fungal and bacterial abundance, although explained variance was low (R2{$<$}0.29). Unraveling complex spatial patterns of nutrient cycling and the biotic factors that regulate it remains challenging but is critical for explaining post-fire ecosystem function, especially in Greater Yellowstone, which is projected to experience increased fire frequencies by mid 21st Century.},

  abstract     = {Fire can cause profound changes in the composition and abundance of plant and animal species, but logistics, unpredictability of weather, and inherent danger make it nearly impossible to study high-severity fire effects experimentally. We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before–after/control–impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed “mixed responders” in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration.},

Are they composed of substantial form and matter? What serves as the formal dimension for such bodies, and what kind of "'primary" matter underlies it7 In the be\textasciitilde nning of his analysis of substance in Metaphy\textasciitilde :,rVII \# 2, Aristotle writes: "Substance seems to occur most clearly in bodies (and so we say that animals and plants and their parts arc substances, and also the natural bodies like fire and water and earth and all similar things, and whatever are parts of these or made up of them, whether of certain ones or of all, such as the heaven and its parts, the stars and moon and sun)" (I02Sb8-13). This is a list of things commonly accepted as substances? Aristotle goes on to say that we must test them to find whether or not common opinion is correct, whether all of these are indeed substances, or only some of them, or none at all. In the pages that follow he devdops his own philosophical theory of substance. In /\textasciitilde{} 16 he turns back to his point of departure in common opinion and decides: "It is clear that of those things that seem to bc substances, most are potentialities: the parts of animals (for none of them is separated; when separated all of them are like matter) and earth and fire and air; for none of these are one. but they are like a heap until they are concocted and some one thing comes out of them" (1040b5-10). Thus critical philosophical analysis shows that in the main common opinion is wrong; most of what it takes to be substances are really not such in the full sense, including the simple bodies, earth, air, fire and water. These are substances only potentially. Aristotle does not discard common opinion entirely; he does not say that simple bodies fail to be substances in any sense at all. But they are not substances in the full sense. Three points must be stressed in this conclusion: (a) The reason the simple bodies are not fully substance is that they lack the unity needed for this: "for none The "common opinion" Aristotle examines is not just popular opinion but also the belief of the physicist-philosopbers who tried to explain things in terms of their parts and the stuff they are made of. These materialistic conceptions about what is real seem to Aristotle to be reflected in common, popular opinion. In contrast the mathematical concept of substance is credited "to certain persons" (1028616) as is belief in the Ideas. The same contrast between belief in the substantiality of bodies as a common opinion, and the esoteric concept of mathematicals and Ideas as held by only a few, is found in Metaphysics VIII \textasciitilde{} 1 (1o4\textasciitilde 7-12). [2631 264 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY of themare one, but they are like a heap." (b) By implication, the simple bodies can be considered substances in the sense of substratum or foundation (hypokeimenon), since they must be "concocted" or properly disposed and worked into the unity of a single thing; that is, they must receive a form, and thus act as a substratum or foundation for that form. 2 For Aristotle, substance can be said in many ways: as form, as substratum or foundation, and as the compound of both. 3 Form or essence is the primary sense of substance, but this does not prevent foundation from being called substance in a derived sense. It is precisely as foundation that matter and the simple bodies can be called substance. (e) In terms of act and potency, matter and the elements are substance only potentially, but this is true whenever substance is taken as foundation. Only form or essence is substance in actuality.4 Since the Metaphysics indicates that simple bodies are not substances in the ordinary sense, our problem is to determine how they are substances at all. Our treatment breaks down into two major sections: \textasciitilde{} 1-\textasciitilde 3 examine what serves as the "formal" dimension in simple bodies, while \textasciitilde{} 4-\# 6 discuss the "material" dimension, the prime matter that underlies...},

Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations increased from 5 to 60 fold over background levels within the first two days of the fire with maximum recorded concentrations for dissolved nutrients reaching as high as 135 μg/L soluble reactive phosphorus, 261 μg/L ammonium, and 61 μg/L nitrate + nitrite. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen levels increased up to 206 μg/L and 349 μg/L respectively. Nutrient concentrations declined to background levels typically {$<$}5-10 μg/L within several days to several weeks. Experimental evidence suggests that the primary source of phosphorus was from leaching of ash deposited directly into the streams during the firestorm while the primary source of nitrogen appeared to be from diffusion of smoke gases into the stream waters.},

Here, we explore how heterogeneity, feedbacks, and external drivers in this type of natural hazard system can lead to complexity and can limit the development of more adaptive approaches to policy and management. Institutions and social networks can counter these limitations and promote adaptation. We also develop a conceptual model that includes a robust characterization of social subsystems for a fire-prone landscape in Oregon and describe how we are building an agent-based model to promote understanding of this social-ecological system. Our agent-based model, which incorporates existing ecological models of vegetation and fire and is based on empirical studies of landowner decision-making, will be used to explore alternative management and fire scenarios with land managers and various public entities. We expect that the development of CHANS frameworks and the application of a simulation model in a collaborative setting will facilitate the development of more effective policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Methods: Cross-sections of 19 remnant pines exhibiting 190 fire scars were collected from a 1.2-km2 area. Tree-rings and fire scars were precisely dated and analysed for the purpose of characterizing past changes in fire and tree growth. Temporal variability in fire occurrence and seasonality was described for the pre- and post-European settlement periods. Seasonality of historic fires was determined by the scar position within the rings. The relationship between fire and drought was investigated using correlation and superposed epoch analysis.
Results: The mean fire return interval for the period 1650-1905 was 2.2 years (range 0.5 to 12 yr). Significant new findings include: evidence for years of biannual burning, temporal variability in fire seasonality, an increase in fire frequency and percentage of trees scarred circa 1790, and synchronous growth suppression and subsequent release of trees coinciding with land-use changes near the turn of the 20th century. Drought conditions appeared unrelated to the occurrence of fire events or fire seasonality.
Conclusions: Multi-century fire history records from longleaf pine ecosystems are difficult to obtain due to historic land-use practices and the species high resistance to scarring; however, our results indicate potential for reconstructing detailed fire histories in this ecosystem. Fire scars quantitatively documented one of the most frequent fire regimes known. Fire regime information, such as the temporal variability in fire intervals, prevalence of late-growing season fire events and biannual burning, provide a new perspective on the dynamics of longleaf pine fire regimes.},

  abstract     = {The forest restoration challenge (globally 2 billion ha) and the prospect of changing climate with increasing frequency of extreme events argues for approaching restoration from a functional and landscape perspective. Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even standlevel restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors.},

  abstract     = {With the phase-out of PentaBDE in 2004, alternative flame retardants are being used in polyurethane foam to meet flammability standards. However, insufficient information is available on the identity of the flame retardants currently in use. Baby products containing polyurethane foam must meet California state furniture flammability standards, which likely affects the use of flame retardants in baby products throughout the U.S. However, it is unclear which products contain flame retardants and at what concentrations. In this study we surveyed baby products containing polyurethane foam to investigate how often flame retardants were used in these products. Information on when the products were purchased and whether they contained a label indicating that the product meets requirements for a California flammability standard were recorded. When possible, we identified the flame retardants being used and their concentrations in the foam. Foam samples collected from 101 commonly used baby products were analyzed. Eighty samples contained an identifiable flame retardant additive, and all but one of these was either chlorinated or brominated. The most common flame retardant detected was tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP; detection frequency 36\%), followed by components typically found in the Firemaster550 commercial mixture (detection frequency 17\%). Five samples contained PBDE congeners commonly associated with PentaBDE, suggesting products with PentaBDE are still in-use. Two chlorinated organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) not previously documented in the environment were also identified, one of which is commercially sold as V6 (detection frequency 15\%) and contains tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) as an impurity. As an addition to this study, we used a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer to estimate the bromine and chlorine content of the foam and investigate whether XRF is a useful method for predicting the presence of halogenated flame retardant additives in these products. A significant correlation was observed for bromine; however, there was no significant relationship observed for chlorine. To the authors knowledge, this is the first study to report on flame retardants in baby products. In addition, we have identified two chlorinated OPFRs not previously documented in the environment or in consumer products. Based on exposure estimates conducted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), we predict that infants may receive greater exposure to TDCPP from these products compared to the average child or adult from upholstered furniture, all of which are higher than acceptable daily intake levels of TDCPP set by the CPSC. Future studies are therefore warranted to specifically measure infants exposure to these flame retardants from intimate contact with these products and to determine if there are any associated health concerns.},

  abstract     = {Ecosystems can change rapidly and sometimes irreversibly due to a number of anthropogenic and natural factors, such as deforestation and fire. How individual animals exposed to such changes respond behaviourally and physiologically is poorly understood. We quantified the phenotypic plasticity of activity patterns and torpor use – a highly efficient energy conservation mechanism – in brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), a small Australian marsupial mammal. We compared groups in densely vegetated forest areas (pre-fire and control) with a group in a burned, open habitat (post-fire). Activity and torpor patterns differed among groups and sexes. Females in the post-fire group spent significantly less time active than the other groups, both during the day and night. However, in males only daytime activity declined in the post-fire group, although overall activity was also reduced on cold days in males for all groups. The reduction in total or diurnal activity in the post-fire group was made energetically possible by a \textasciitilde 3.4-fold and \textasciitilde 2.2-fold increase in the proportion of time females and males, respectively, used torpor in comparison to that in the pre-fire and control groups. Overall, likely due to reproductive needs, torpor was more pronounced in females than in males, but low ambient temperatures increased torpor bout duration in both sexes. Importantly, for both male and female antechinus and likely other small mammals, predator avoidance and energy conservation – achieved by reduced activity and increased torpor use – appear to be vital for post-fire survival where ground cover and refuges have been obliterated.},

  abstract     = {Recent work has shown that the use of torpor for energy conservation increases after forest fires in heterothermic mammals, probably in response to the reduction of food. However, the specific environmental cues for this increased torpor expression remain unknown. It is possible that smoke and the novel substrate of charcoal and ash act as signals for an impending period of starvation requiring torpor. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the combined cues of smoke, a charcoal/ash substrate and food shortage will enhance torpor expression in a small forest-dwelling marsupial, the yellowfooted antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), because like other animals that live in fire-prone habitats they must effectively respond to fires to ensure survival. Activity and body temperature patterns of individuals in outdoor aviaries were measured under natural environmental conditions. All individuals were strictly nocturnal, but diurnal activity was observed shortly after smoke exposure. Overall, torpor in females was longer and deeper than that in males. Interestingly, while both males and females increased daily torpor duration during food restriction by {$>$}2-fold as anticipated, a combination of food restriction and smoke exposure on a charcoal/ash substrate further increased daily torpor duration by ∼2-fold in both sexes. These data show that this combination of cues for torpor induction is stronger than food shortage on its own. Our study provides significant new information on how a small forest-dwelling mammal responds to fire cues during and immediately after a fire and identifies a new, not previously recognised, regulatory mechanism for thermal biology in mammals.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Tropical savannas are a globally extensive biome prone to rapid vegetation change in response to changing environmental conditions. Via a meta-analysis, we quantified savanna woody vegetation change spanning the last century. We found a global trend of woody encroachment that was established prior the 1980s. However, there is critical regional variation in the magnitude of encroachment. Woody cover is increasing most rapidly in the remaining uncleared savannas of South America, most likely due to fire suppression and land fragmentation. In contrast, Australia has experienced low rates of encroachment. When accounting for land use, African savannas have a mean rate annual woody cover increase two and a half times that of Australian savannas. In Africa, encroachment occurs across multiple land uses and is accelerating over time. In Africa and Australia, rising atmospheric CO2, changing land management and rainfall are likely causes. We argue that the functional traits of each woody flora, specifically the N-fixing ability and architecture of woody plants, are critical to predicting encroachment over the next century and that African savannas are at high risk of widespread vegetation change.},

  abstract     = {Ash plays an important role in controlling runoff and erosion processes after wildfire and has frequently been hypothesised to clog soil pores and reduce infiltration. Yet evidence for clogging is incomplete, as research has focussed on identifying the presence of ash in soil; the actual flow processes remain unknown. We conducted laboratory infiltration experiments coupled with microscope observations in pure sands, saturated hydraulic conductivity analysis, and interaction energy calculations, to test whether ash can clog pores (i.e. block pores such that infiltration is hampered and ponding occurs). Although results confirmed previous observations of ash washing into pores, clogging was not observed in the pure sands tested, nor were conditions found for which this does occur. Clogging by means of strong attachment of ash to sand was deemed unlikely given the negative surface charge of the two materials. Ponding due to washing in of ash was also considered improbable given the high saturated conductivity of pure ash and ash–sand mixtures. This first mechanistic step towards analysing ash transport and attachment processes in field soils therefore suggests that pore clogging by ash is unlikely to occur in sands. Discussion is provided on other mechanisms by which ash can affect post-fire hydrology.},

  abstract     = {Emissions from open vegetation fires contribute significantly to global atmospheric dynamics. However, the value of improved quantification of areas burned and knowledge of the composition and structure of biomass fuel is compromised in current emissions modelling and measurement by inadequate understanding of the chemistry of biomass combustion. Physical models of the behaviour of open vegetation fires also have relied on over-simplified combustion chemistry. Considerable knowledge of the thermal degradation and combustion of cellulose, the major constituent of the terrestrial biomass, exists but has yet to make an impact in the fields of atmospheric emissions monitoring and open vegetation fire behaviour modelling. This article provides an interpretive summary of the current knowledge of the chemistry and dynamics of the processes of thermal degradation and combustion of cellulosic biomass and discusses the role of these processes in determining the emissions from, and behaviour of, open fires in such fuels. The important role of competitive thermal decomposition is emphasised, as a driver and regulator of emissions and fire spread (short-term, local effects) and global carbon distributions (longterm, global effects).},

              Forest fires are a common natural disturbance in forested ecosystems and have a large impact on the microbial communities in forest soils. The response of soil fungal communities to forest fire is poorly documented. Here, we investigated fungal community structure and function across a 152-year boreal forest fire chronosequence using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region and a functional gene array (GeoChip). Our results demonstrate that the boreal forest soil fungal community was most diverse soon after a fire disturbance and declined over time. The differences in the fungal communities were explained by changes in the abundance of basidiomycetes and ascomycetes. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi contributed to the increase in basidiomycete abundance over time, with the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) representing the genera
              Cortinarius
              and
              Piloderma
              dominating in abundance. Hierarchical cluster analysis by using gene signal intensity revealed that the sites with different fire histories formed separate clusters, suggesting differences in the potential to maintain essential biogeochemical soil processes. The site with the greatest biological diversity had also the most diverse genes. The genes involved in organic matter degradation in the mature forest, in which ECM fungi were the most abundant, were as common in the youngest site, in which saprotrophic fungi had a relatively higher abundance. This study provides insight into the impact of fire disturbance on soil fungal community dynamics.},

Many causes for the lack of herb growth in gaps have been postulated, including lack of seeds in the soil, limited nutrients and water, competition with shrubs for resources, interference competition (i.e., allelopathy), and herbivory. An experiment was conducted to assess the individual and combined effects of four main factors (trenching to reduce root competition, caging to reduce herbivory, nutrient addition, and water addition) on herb germination, survival, and growth in chaparral dominated by chamise, Adenostoma fasciculatum. We found strong interactions among these treatments. Therefore, no single factor can be regarded as causing the absence of herbs in chaparral. Herb establishment was limited by herbivory and root competition with shrubs for limited nutrients and/or water. Survival was enhanced by trenching, caging, and water. Growth was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the magnitude of this nutrient effect became appreciable only within trenched, caged plots. The vegetative cover of annual herbs in gaps was limited by the combined effects of herbivory, competition with the roots of shrubs, inadequate nutrients, and inadequate water.},

Fire spread was controlled by topographic barriers such as ridges and valleys, although this was not clear in the areas with serpentinite. Fire frequency was higher on windward slopes of the prevailing wind, and the size of the burned area varied with the underlying geology, which controlled the areal extent of hillside slopes. In areas with terrace deposits, Wakkanai Formation or serpentinized rock, burned areas were large and included few unburned stands. The type of vegetation that grew following the fires varied with slope aspect and topographic position. Sasa grasslands often formed at wind-exposed sites. The grasslands were well developed in the three areas with the previously mentioned geology, where large-scale burning had occurred. Structure of the re-established forest stands was also affected by landforms. Canopy height and the maximum diameter at breast height varied with slope aspect, topographic position and elevation, as well as with stand age. Tree size was found to decrease at wind-exposed sites within high-elevation zones.},

A variety of ambient wind velocities and fuel flow rates were employed to study different fire scenarios modeling the dynamics of wind-driven fire spread as found in wildland, mine or tunnel fires. The downstream heat flux distribution was correlated as a piecewise function with the Richardson number in two regimes, the first with higher heat fluxes, where the flame remained attached the downstream surface (attached region) and the second with a steeper decay of heat fluxes (plume region). Analysis of the heat flux distribution revealed that local heat fluxes roughly reach a maximum where the Richardson number equaled unity. This was thought to be a good marker of the regime where the flame detaches from the surface, e.g. where buoyancy from the flame overcomes inertial forces from the oncoming flow. This observation was further corroborated by analysis of side-view images of the flame, which showed the attachment location was linearly correlated with the location where the Richardson number equaled unity. The results from this study suggest that local heat flux values reach a maximum at the transition between a momentum-dominated (attached, wind-driven) to buoyancydominated (plume or fire) regime in forced flow scenarios. The results have interesting implications to the problem of flame attachment, which is known to accelerate fire spread in both inclined and wind-driven fire scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The scientific community interested in atmospheric chemistry, gas emissions from vegetation fires, and carbon cycling is currently demanding information on the extent and timing of biomass burning at the global scale. In fact, the area and type of vegetation that is burned on a monthly or annual basis are two of the parameters that provide the greatest uncertainty in the calculation of gas and aerosol emissions and burned biomass. To address this need, an inventory of burned areas at monthly time periods for the year 2000 at a resolution of 1 km2 has been produced using satellite data and has been made freely available to the scientific community. In this paper, estimates of burned area and number of burn scars for four broad vegetation classes and reported at the country level for the year 2000 are presented using data taken from the inventory. Over 3.5 million km2 of burned areas were detected in the year 2000, of which approximately 80\% occurred in areas described as woodlands and shrublands. Approximately 17\% of the burned area occurred in grasslands and croplands, the remaining 3\% occurred in forests. Almost 600,000 separate burn scars were detected. Descriptions of vegetation burning activity are given for ten regions. Finally, monthly burned area estimates are presented for the Central African Republic to illustrate the usefulness of these data for understanding, monitoring and managing vegetation burning activities.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACT In many parts of the world forest disturbance regimes have intensified recently, and future climatic changes are expected to amplify this development further in the coming decades. These changes are increasingly challenging the main objectives of forest ecosystem management, which are to provide ecosystem services sustainably to society and maintain the biological diversity of forests. Yet a comprehensive understanding of how disturbances affect these primary goals of ecosystem management is still lacking. We conducted a global literature review on the impact of three of the most important disturbance agents (fire, wind, and bark beetles) on 13 different ecosystem services and three indicators of biodiversity in forests of the boreal, cool- and warm-temperate biomes. Our objectives were to (i) synthesize the effect of natural disturbances on a wide range of possible objectives of forest management, and (ii) investigate standardized effect sizes of disturbance for selected indicators via a quantitative meta-analysis. We screened a total of 1958 disturbance studies published between 1981 and 2013, and reviewed 478 in detail. We first investigated the overall effect of disturbances on individual ecosystem services and indicators of biodiversity by means of independence tests, and subsequently examined the effect size of disturbances on indicators of carbon storage and biodiversity by means of regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the effect of commonly used approaches of disturbance management, i.e. salvage logging and prescribed burning. We found that disturbance impacts on ecosystem services are generally negative, an effect that was supported for all categories of ecosystem services, i.e. supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services (P {$<$} 0.001). Indicators of biodiversity, i.e. species richness, habitat quality and diversity indices, on the other hand were found to be influenced positively by disturbance (P {$<$} 0.001). Our analyses thus reveal a ?disturbance paradox?, documenting that disturbances can put ecosystem services at risk while simultaneously facilitating biodiversity. A detailed investigation of disturbance effect sizes on carbon storage and biodiversity further underlined these divergent effects of disturbance. While a disturbance event on average causes a decrease in total ecosystem carbon by 38.5\% (standardized coefficient for stand-replacing disturbance), it on average increases overall species richness by 35.6\%. Disturbance-management approaches such as salvage logging and prescribed burning were neither found significantly to mitigate negative effects on ecosystem services nor to enhance positive effects on biodiversity, and thus were not found to alleviate the disturbance paradox. Considering that climate change is expected to intensify natural disturbance regimes, our results indicate that biodiversity will generally benefit from such changes while a sustainable provisioning of ecosystem services might come increasingly under pressure. This underlines that disturbance risk and resilience require increased attention in ecosystem management in the future, and that new approaches to addressing the disturbance paradox in management are needed.},

  abstract = {Key message Conifers which substantially lost foliage in wildfires were also reduced in their relative hydraulic capacity, resulting in little change in water use efficiency. AbstractWildfires are a natural and ubiquitous component of many forests. Fire-induced damages can lead to immediate tree mortality or a prolonged state of decline. However, physiological mechanisms behind the phenomenon are not well understood. We investigated physiological properties of conifers that survived wildfire 2 year post-fire in central Idaho, USA. In 2005, we set up a burned plot at each of three sites, where the independent wildfires damaged dominant conifers in 2003, paired with a comparable adjacent control plot without any fire damage. At each burned plot, we assessed physical damages in the burned conifers. At each plot in a given site, we repeatedly measured physiological characteristics in five trees of a dominant conifer species (Pseudotsuga menziesii or Pinus contorta) to compare burned and control plots across the three sites during the 2005 growing season. Growth of the burned conifers was significantly reduced post-fire. Leaf area of burned conifers was significantly reduced due to scorching, which, in theory, should have led to increased stomatal conductance (g s) and leaf specific conductance (K L). However, we did not find significant differences in K L between burned and control conifers, and g s was sometimes even lower in burned than control conifers. These results indicate the wildfires reduced capacity of hydraulic apparatus in the surviving conifers, partly due to reduced sapwood area associated with the decreased stem growth post-fire. This was supported by our finding that integrated water use efficiency, assessed via δ13C of woody materials and foliage, was not significantly affected by the wildfires.},

  abstract     = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The impact of biomass burning aerosol (BBA) on the regional climate in South
America is assessed using 30-year simulations with a global atmosphere-only
configuration of the Met Office Unified Model. We compare two simulations of
high and low emissions of biomass burning aerosol based on realistic
interannual variability. The aerosol scheme in the model has hygroscopic
growth and optical properties for BBA informed by recent observations,
including those from the recent South American Biomass Burning Analysis
(SAMBBA) intensive aircraft observations made during September 2012. We find
that the difference in the September (peak biomass emissions month) BBA
optical depth between a simulation with high emissions and a simulation with
low emissions corresponds well to the difference in the BBA emissions between
the two simulations, with a 71.6\% reduction from high to low emissions
for both the BBA emissions and the BB AOD in the region with maximum
emissions (defined by a box of extent 5–25\textsuperscript{∘}S, 40–70\textsuperscript{∘}W,
used for calculating mean values given below). The cloud cover at all
altitudes in the region of greatest BBA difference is reduced as a result of
the semi-direct effect, by heating of the atmosphere by the BBA and changes
in the atmospheric stability and surface fluxes. Within the BBA layer the
cloud is reduced by burn-off, while the higher cloud changes appear to be
responding to stability changes. The boundary layer is reduced in height and
stabilized by increased BBA, resulting in reduced deep convection and reduced
cloud cover at heights of 9–14km, above the layer of BBA. Despite the
decrease in cloud fraction, September downwelling clear-sky and all-sky
shortwave radiation at the surface is reduced for higher emissions by
13.77±0.39Wm\textsuperscript{−2} (clear-sky) and
7.37±2.29Wm\textsuperscript{−2} (all-sky), whilst the upwelling shortwave
radiation at the top of atmosphere is increased in clear sky by

aerosol layer by 18\% in the high emissions case. The mean surface
temperature is reduced by 0.14±0.24\textsuperscript{∘}C and mean
precipitation is reduced by 14.5\% in the peak biomass region due to both
changes in cloud cover and cloud microphysical properties. If the increase in
BBA occurs in a particularly dry year, the resulting reduction in
precipitation may exacerbate the drought. The position of the South Atlantic
high pressure is slightly altered by the presence of increased BBA, and the
strength of the southward low-level jet to the east of the Andes is
increased. There is some evidence that some impacts of increased BBA persist
through the transition into the monsoon, particularly in precipitation, but
the differences are only statistically significant in some small regions in
November. This study therefore provides an insight into how variability in
deforestation, realized through variability in biomass burning emissions, may
contribute to the South American climate, and consequently on the possible
impacts of future changes in BBA emissions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract     = {A set of experiments at laboratory scale was conducted to study the combustion of forest fuel beds in order to quantify the contribution of radiant and convective heat transfer under slope condition. To proceed, a Large Scale Heat Release apparatus was used to measure the heat release rate and fire properties such as the mass loss rate, the geometry of the fire front and the heat transfer were assessed. Because of the slope and the size of the fuel bed, the mass loss rate and the heat release rate do not reach a quasisteady state when the propagation takes place under slope condition. This is due to a V-shape distortion of the fire front, which leads to an increase of the burnt surface rate by the fire over time. The study of this quantity has shown that the heat release over time can be estimated with the fuel load and the time derivative of the burnt surface. The fractions of radiation and convection released by the fire in its environment were calculated. Under a slope of 20°, the convective fraction decreases from 74.9\% to 61.1\% whereas the overall radiant fraction ranges between 25.1\% and 38.9\% and increases with increasing fuel loads.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed burning currently is used to preserve endemicity of plant communities in remnant tallgrass prairies. Although some types of arthropods benefit from changes in plant communities brought about by burning, other species that are endemic to prairies may be threatened. Because they inhabit the ‘fuel layer’ of prairies, endophytic insects would seem particularly susceptible to this management tactic. In this paper, we assess the impact of prescribed burning on endophytic insect communities inhabiting stems of Silphium laciniatum L. and S. terebinthinaceum Jacquin (Asteraceae), endemic prairie plants. Populations of these insects were decimated by burning, with mortality approaching 100\% in most cases. Their populations nevertheless began to rebound within a single growing season, with densities moderately but significantly reduced 1 year after the burn. Even when a prairie remnant was completely incinerated, plant stems were recolonized by insects within one growing season. Our findings suggest that sufficient numbers of endophytic insects survive burns in remains of Silphium to recolonize burned areas the following year.},

Time of burning markedly altered the physiognomy and was the crucial factor effecting vegetation change. Late-spring burning, coinciding with emergence of the warm-season perennial grasses, increased grass production and favored Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans. Burning in winter, early-spring, or mid-spring reduced herbage production and shifted vegetational composition by differentially favoring other species. Andropogon scoparius increased with mid- and early-spring burning, while perennial forbs and sedges increased with early-spring and winter burning. Amorpha canescens was favored by all burning treatments. Mulch buildup in unburned, undisturbed plots increased Poa pratensis and tree species and eventually reduced grass production. The long-term effects of annual late-spring burning, even in dry years, was not detrimental to herbage production, species composition, or total basal cover in tallgrass prairie.},

  abstract     = {In tropical savannas, such as the campo cerrado in Brazil, fire plays an important role, affecting plant species’ life history. Since fire has the potential to modify the structure of savanna communities as a whole, it is expected that it may influence the resource supply for mutualists by altering the pattern of investment in sexual reproduction. We used an experimental approach to test if fire alters trophic resource availability to pollinators (nectar, pollen, and oil) and seed-dispersing frugivores (fleshy fruits) by altering the seasonality of reproductive phenophases in a savanna community. We sampled all individuals of 60 species that were common to both control and experimental fire treatments. Each month we recorded the number of reproductive individuals to test whether fire affected the temporal resource offered by the plant assemblage as a whole, and by each specific plant group supporting distinct groups of pollinators and seed-dispersing frugivores. We noticed that fire advanced the nectar, pollen, and fleshy fruit offered by the whole assemblage. Additionally, fire affected the temporal pattern of nectar and pollen available to various pollinator groups, and of fleshy fruits available to all seed-dispersing frugivores. In general, fire seems to have a neutral or even a positive effect on resource availability to mutualists. Nevertheless, there were differences in the availability of the resource utilized by each guild of mutualists.},

  abstract     = {Changes in key drivers (e.g., climate, disturbance regimes and land use) may affect the sustainability of forest landscapes and set the stage for increased tension among competing ecosystem services. We addressed two questions about a suite of supporting, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in each of two well-studied forest landscapes in the western US: (1) How might the provision of ecosystem services change in the future given anticipated trajectories of climate, disturbance regimes, and land use? (2) What is the role of spatial heterogeneity in sustaining future ecosystem services? We determined that future changes in each region are likely to be distinct, but spatial heterogeneity (e.g., the amount and arrangement of surviving forest patches or legacy trees after disturbance) will be important in both landscapes for sustaining forest regeneration, primary production, carbon storage, natural hazard regulation, insect and pathogen regulation, timber production and wildlife habitat. The paper closes by highlighting five general priorities for future research. The science of landscape ecology has much to contribute toward understanding ecosystem services and how land management can enhance—or threaten—the sustainability of ecosystem services in changing landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Fire is the major disturbance in North American boreal forests, and is thought to be the most important process that determines the carbon balance in North American boreal forests. This study conducted four years of tower flux measurements in a burned ecosystem from one to four years after a fire, and nine years of measurements in a young regeneration from five to 13 years after a fire in interior Alaska. The fire scar acted as a source of 248\,g C m−2 yr-1 one year after the fire, and the annual CO2 emissions continuously decreased until seven years after the fire. At the final year of the study period, 13 years after the fire, the older forest became a CO2 sink. During the 13 years after the fires, the total post-fire emissions were 767\,g C m−2 across both sites. Gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) recovered to those of mature black spruce forests 10 years after the fire. The successional recovery of GPP was mostly explained by the recovery of the leaf area index (LAI). Anomalous weather, such as a cold spring, hot summer, and high summer rainfall, increased the CO2 emissions rather than the uptake. In interior Alaska, the post-fire CO2 emissions (35–48\,Tg C) were estimated to be approximately one third to fourth of the direct CO2 emissions (156\,Tg C) by combustions from 1998 to 2017, which indicates that post-fire emissions are important to the regional CO2 balance. The forest successional trajectory at young age still contains large uncertainties due to lack of data, and thus adding new data improves our understanding of the post-fire CO2 balance.},

  abstract = {During natural and prescribed fires, combustion of heavy surface fuel loads can expose underlying soil to high temperatures causing thermal alteration of soil minerals and other changes in soil properties. We studied the effect of fire on soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) by comparing severely burned soils to nearby unburned soils at five forest and woodland sites in California, USA. Combusted logs and heavy fuel produced reddened zones of thermally altered soil underlain by blackened zones where heat exposure was lower. The cation exchange capacities of the reddened soils were 57 to 82\% lower than the unburned soil while the blackened soils had 31 to 53\% less CEC than unburned soil. The reddened soil experienced the highest burning temperatures resulting in the loss of organic carbon (OC), the conversion of goethite to maghemite or hematite, the destruction of kaolin, and dehydroxylation and permanent collapse of vermiculite and chlorite. Overall, most of the CEC loss was due to thermal destruction of soil organic matter (SOM), but this CEC will be restored in the post-fire ecosystem succession as biomass re-accumulates and rebuilds soil humus. The loss of CEC due to mineral alteration is longer lasting, though limited in spatial extent.},

Charcoal concentrations ranged from 6-14,799 fragments/gram of sediment, and mean charcoal abundance was negatively correlated with longitude. Results suggest periods of increased fire from A.D. 1700-1740 and A.D. 1850-1900. These peaks were broadly synchronous across the region and ranged in duration from 20-40 yr. Postsettlement patterns of charcoal deposition were highly variable but generally much lower than presettlement intervals.},

  abstract = {Fire evolved on the Earth under the direct influence of climate and the accumulation of burnable biomass at various times and spatial scales. However, since humans have been using fire, fire regimes depend not only on climatic and biological factors, but also strongly reflect the cultural background of how people manage ecosystems and fire. Besides the overall global variability of biomes and cultures, common evolutionary patterns of fire regimes can be detected worldwide in relation to the geographical extension and intensification of human pressure on the land. Pyne (2001) in his historical research identified such common patterns outlining three main fire epochs that are common to most fire histories worldwide: natural, anthropogenic, and industrial fire regimes. Castellnou and Miralles (2009) further detailed the industrial fire epoch by differentiating among “generations of large wildfires”. In this paper we reconstruct the fire history and related landscape evolution that occurred in the Alps during the Holocene in relation to the classifications proposed by Pyne (2001) and Castellnou and Miralles (2009). Negative and positive impacts of current fire regimes on the value of ecosystem services in the Alps are described, as well as the incidence of human fire uses and fire suppression policies. Present and future fire management strategies are discussed assuming that fire is still an important trigger for landscape and habitat diversity, cultural landscape maintenance, and a post-management driver of forest ecosystems in the Alps. We conclude that complete removal of such a disturbance from the Alpine area is neither feasible nor advisable.},

  abstract     = {Context After wildfire, surviving trees are of major ecological importance as they can help in the post-fire regeneration process. Although these trees may be damaged, they may also benefit from reduced fuel hazard and competition. However, little is known about the long-term growth response of surviving trees. Aims This study aims to explain short- to long-term variations in the postfire growth of surviving black pines in an area burnt in 1994, focusing on levels of fire severity and tree sizes. Methods Relative basal area increments were used to detect time-course variations in postfire radial tree growth depending on fire severity. Linear mixed-effects models were used to describe the factors affecting postfire ring growth. Results In the short term, fire caused stronger reduction in growth in small trees with increasing bole char height. However, as time since fire increased, a positive effect of fire on growth due to reduced competition counteracted the short-term fire impacts. Indeed, small surviving trees demonstrated a surge in growth 15 years after the fire. Conclusion It was concluded that reduced competition might offset the short-term negative effects of fire in surviving black pines.},

  abstract     = {Landscape fires show large variability in the amount of biomass or fuel consumed per unit area burned. These fuel consumption (FC) rates depend on the biomass available to burn and the fraction of the biomass that is actually combusted, and can be com5 bined with estimates of area burned to assess emissions. While burned area can be detected from space and estimates are becoming more reliable due to improved algorithms and sensors, FC rates are either modeled or taken selectively from the literature. We compiled the peer-reviewed literature on FC rates for various biomes and fuel categories to better understand FC rates and variability, and to provide a database that can 10 be used to constrain biogeochemical models with fire modules. We compiled in total 76 studies covering 10 biomes including savanna (15 studies, average FC of 4.6 t DM (dry matter) ha−1), tropical forest (n = 19, FC = 126), temperate forest (n = 11, FC = 93), boreal forest (n = 16, FC = 39), pasture (n = 6, FC = 28), crop residue (n = 4, FC = 6.5), chaparral (n = 2, FC = 32), tropical peatland (n = 4, FC = 314), boreal peatland (n = 2, 15 FC = 42), and tundra (n = 1, FC = 40). Within biomes the regional variability in the number of measurements was sometimes large, with e.g. only 3 measurement locations in boreal Russia and 35 sites in North America. Substantial regional differences were found within the defined biomes: for example FC rates of temperate pine forests in the USA were 38 \% higher than Australian forests dominated by eucalypt trees. Besides 20 showing the differences between biomes, FC estimates were also grouped into different fuel classes. Our results highlight the large variability in FC rates, not only between biomes but also within biomes and fuel classes. This implies that care should be taken with using averaged values, and our comparison with FC rates from GFED3 indicates that also modeling studies have difficulty in representing the dynamics governing FC.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic effectiveness of using prescribed summer burns compared to more commonly used practices for managing invasive woody plants. The research incorporates four contiguous counties in the Rolling Plains, Edwards Plateau and South Texas Plains eco-regions in Texas. Focus group meetings were held with landowners and NRCS and Texas AgriLife Extension personnel to obtain information about the most common economic uses of rangeland resources by landowners, the dominant invasive brush species, and the most commonly used practices and associated costs for controlling these invasive plants. An investment feasibility model was used to compare the economic efficacy of applying extreme fire and other commonly applied treatments to manage invasive brush species in the three Texas eco-regions. The economic analysis indicated that extreme fire was economically superior in all three regions and was the only treatment alternative that resulted in positive returns on investments in the treatments. The analysis included cost-share, which indicated increased returns for extreme fire and less negative returns for alternative treatments. The results of our study have implications for the review of current NRCS technical standards with respect to prescribed fire.},

  abstract     = {Pollinators serve critical roles for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and have an estimated annual value of over \$150 billion for global agriculture. Mounting evidence from agricultural systems reveals that pollinators are declining in many regions of the world, and with a lack of information on whether pollinator communities in natural systems are following similar trends, identifying factors which support pollinator visitation and services are important for ameliorating the effects of the current global pollinator crisis. We investigated how fire affects resource structure and how that variation influences floral pollinator communities by comparing burn versus control treatments in a southeastern USA old-field system. We hypothesized and found a positive relationship between fire and plant density of a native forb, Verbesina alternifolia, as well as a significant difference in floral visitation of V. alternifolia between burn and control treatments. V. alternifolia density was 44\% greater and floral visitation was 54\% greater in burned treatments relative to control sites. When the density of V. alternifolia was experimentally reduced in the burn sites to equivalent densities observed in control sites, floral visitation in burned sites declined to rates found in control sites. Our results indicate that plant density is a proximal mechanism by which an imposed fire regime can indirectly impact floral visitation, suggesting its usefulness as a tool for management of pollination services. Although concerns surround the negative impacts of management, indirect positive effects may provide an important direction to explore for managing future ecological and conservation issues. Studies examining the interaction among resource concentration, plant apparency, and how fire affects the evolutionary consequences of altered patterns of floral visitation are overdue.},

In this region, the implementation of prescribed burning to conserve biodiversity must take into account the area's rugged and inaccessible terrain and recurrent wildfires, the presence of fire-adapted invasive alien plants, and the imperatives for ensuring human safety. These constraints limit the potential for prescribed burning to be effective everywhere, and prioritization and trade-offs will be needed to ensure the efficient use of limited funding and management capacity. In such environments, management must be adaptive, based on clearly defined and shared goals, monitoring, and assessment, and should be flexible enough to adjust as new lessons are learned.},

It provides a real-life example of adaptive learning in an environment where understanding is incomplete, but where management nonetheless has to proceed. The previous policy called for the application of fire to meet burnt area targets that were set for administrative subdivisions, and that were assessed at the scale of the entire park. This was problematic because the park is large and heterogeneous, and because sound ecological motivations that could link burning prescriptions to ecological objectives were missing. The new policy divides the park into five fire management zones on the basis of differences in mean annual rainfall, historic fire return periods, and geology. In addition, it proposes fire management actions designed to achieve specified ecological objectives in each zone, and includes fire-regime related thresholds and associated ecological outcomes against which to assess the effectiveness of management. The new policy is an improvement over previous iterations, but several challenges remain. Most important among these would be to continually improve the understanding of the effects of fire, and to develop frameworks for assessing the impacts of fire together with other ecosystem drivers that interact strongly with fire to influence the attainment of ecological objectives.},

  abstract = {This study examined the effect of wildfire on the physical degradation of two forest soils in NW Spain and compared this against changes produced by controlled laboratory heating experiments in which unburned soils from neighbouring sites were exposed to five different heating regimes. The physical soil degradation was considered with respect to organic carbon content, dry aggregate size distribution, water aggregate stability, water repellency, and hydraulic conductivity. The results of this analysis show that the changes in the physical properties of the wildfire-affected soils were similar to the changes observed in the heating experiments. However, the wildfire had contrasting effects in terms of soil physical degradation at the two study sites, which can be attributed to differences in soil heating regimes and fire severity. At one study site, the wildfire did not produce marked changes in organic carbon content or in aggregation, except for a slight fragmentation of macro-aggregates into micro-aggregates. Also, soil water repellency remained very strong after the wildfire, resulting in low hydraulic conductivity. Based on the laboratory experiments, the soil at this site was not exposed to temperatures above 220 °C. The wildfire at the other study site resulted in more pronounced degradation of the soil, as shown in the reduction of organic carbon content by almost 50\%, resulting in reduced stability of the aggregates. The wildfire also reduced soil water repellency considerably, but hydraulic conductivity did not increase noticeably. In this case the soil could be exposed to temperatures between 220 and 380 °C.},

  abstract     = {Most wildfires occur during summer in the northern hemisphere, the area burned annually is increasing, and fire effects during this season are least understood. Understanding plant response to grazing following summer fire is required to reduce ecological and financial risks associated with wildfire. Forty 0.75-ha plots were assigned to summer fire then 0, 17, 34 or 50\% biomass removal by grazing the following growing season, or no fire and no grazing. Root, litter, and aboveground biomass were measured before fire, immediately after grazing, and 1 yr after grazing with the experiment repeated during 2 yr to evaluate weather effects. Fire years were followed by the second driest and fifth wettest springs in 70 yr. Biomass was more responsive to weather than fire and grazing, with a 452\% increase from a dry to wet year and 31\% reduction from a wet to average spring. Fire reduced litter 53\% and had no first-year effect on productivity for any biomass component. Grazing after fire reduced postgrazing grass biomass along the prescribed utilization gradient. Fire and grazing had no effect on total aboveground productivity the year after grazing compared to nonburned, nongrazed sites (1 327 vs. 1 249 6 65 kg Á haÀ1). Fire and grazing increased grass productivity 16\%, particularly for Pascopyrum smithii. The combined disturbances reduced forbs (51\%), annual grasses (49\%), and litter (46\%). Results indicate grazing with up to 50\% biomass removal the first growing season after summer fire was not detrimental to productivity of semiarid rangeland plant communities. Livestock exclusion the year after summer fire did not increase productivity or shift species composition compared to grazed sites. Reduction of previous years’ standing dead material was the only indication that fire may temporarily reduce forage availability. The consistent responses among dry, wet, and near-average years suggest plant response is species-specific rather than climatically controlled.},

  abstract     = {1 Resprouting has been much studied in mature plants and seedlings, but with little attention to how resprouting ability may change with ontogeny in cross-species datasets. Because damage exposure and avoidance through large size may differ between growth forms, size-stage, growth form and disturbance type may interact. 2 A Bayesian mixed-effects model was used to analyse a wide-ranging literature dataset of resprouting responses following clipping or burning. There were distinct ontogenetic patterns of resprouting ability between growth forms. In ground-dwelling plants, seedling resprouting ability was high and was maintained as plants grew. In trees, survivorship increased with size-stage. However, for disturbances resulting in stem-kill, resprouting ability of trees declined with increasing size. 3 The finding of distinct ontogenetic patterns of sprouting ability between growth forms demonstrates how species trade-off damage avoidance with resprouting ability to achieve persistence, and provides an example of the life-history trade-off of avoidance and tolerance of damage. 4 Large random effects associated with between-species variation indicated that although such ontogenetic patterns can be detected, each growth form contains species employing diverse strategies. Bayesian modelling enables flexible and powerful analyses of literature datasets, to reveal diverse strategies often obscured by classical analyses exploring only main effects.},

  abstract     = {1. Wildfires are often followed by severe, sediment-laden floods in burned catchments. In this study, we documented resistance and resilience of stream insect communities to repeated postfire flash floods in a ‘burned stream’. We employed a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design, where communities in comparable reaches of a burned stream and a reference stream were sampled from 2 years before, to 6 years after, a crown wildfire in north-central New Mexico. 2. The first 100-year flood following the 1996 Dome wildfire reduced total insect density and taxon richness to near zero in the burned stream. Despite showing low resistance, density returned rapidly to prefire levels because of colonisation by simuliids, chironomids and the mayfly Baetis tricaudatus. In general, taxa that were generalist feeders (collectors) with strong larval dispersal dominated communities in early postfire years with repeated, moderate flash floods. 3. Taxon richness and community composition were less resilient to postfire hydrologic disturbances. Taxon richness did not recover until floods dampened 4 years after the fire. Despite hydrologic recovery, composition in the burned stream still differed from prefire and reference stream compositions after 6 years postfire. A unique assemblage, dominated by taxa with strong larval or adult dispersal, was established after flash floods abated. Specialist feeders (shredders and grazers) that were common in prefire years were reduced or absent in the postfire assemblage. 4. Community succession in the burned stream was explained by the interaction between species traits, geographic barriers to colonisation and hydrologic conditions after the fire. Comparable changes in insect density, taxon richness, community composition and trait representation were not found in the reference stream, providing strong evidence that repeated postfire flash floods shaped community responses in the burned stream.},

Seven headwater catchments with varying levels of disturbance (burned, post-fire salvage logged, and unburned) were instrumented as part of the Southern Rockies Watershed Project to measure streamflow, stream temperature, and meteorological conditions. From 2004 to 2010 mean annual stream temperature (Ts) was elevated 0.8–2.1 °C in the burned and post-fire salvage logged streams compared to the unburned streams. Mean daily maximum Ts was 1.0–3.0 °C warmer and mean daily minimum Ts was 0.9–2.8 °C warmer in the burned and post-fire salvage logged streams compared to the unburned catchments. The effects of wildfire on the thermal regime of the burned catchments were persistent and trend analysis showed no apparent recovery during the study period. Temporal patterns of Ts were strongly associated with seasonal variability of surface and groundwater interactions and air temperature. Advective heat fluxes between groundwater and surface water were likely the dominant controls on Ts, though the strength of these advective controls varied among catchments highlighting the importance of simultaneous catchment-scale and process-focused research to better elucidate the physical drivers influencing Ts response to disturbance.},

  abstract     = {A comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the effects of fire on ecosystem nitrogen (N) is urgently needed for directing future fire research and management. This study used a meta-analysis method to synthesize up to 185 data sets from 87 studies published from 1955 to 1999. Six N response variables related to fire were examined: fuel N amount (FNA) and concentration (FNC), soil N amount (SNA) and concentration (SNC), and soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) pools. When all comparisons (fire treatment vs. control) were considered together, fire significantly reduced FNA (58\%), increased soil NH4+ (94\%) and NO3− (152\%), and had no significant influences on FNC, SNA, and SNC. The responses of N to fire varied with different independent variables, which were vegetation type, fire type, fuel type, fuel consumption amount, fuel consumption percentage, time after fire, and soil sampling depth. The response of FNA to fire was significantly influenced by vegetation type, fuel type, and fuel consumption amount and percentage. The reduction in FNA was linearly correlated with fuel consumption percentage (r2 = 0.978). The response of FNC to fire was only affected by fuel type. None of the seven independent variables had any effect on SNA. The responses of SNC, NH4+, and NO3− depend on soil sampling depth. The responses of both NH4+ and NO3− to fire were significantly affected by fire type and time after fire but had different temporal patterns. The soil NH4+ pool increased approximately twofold immediately after fire, then gradually declined to the prefire level after one year. The fire-induced increase in the soil NO3− pool was small (24\%) immediately after fire, reached a maximum of approximately threefold of the prefire level within 0.5–1 year after fire, and then declined. This study has identified the general patterns of the responses of ecosystem N that occur for several years after fire. A key research need relevant to fire management is to understand how the short-term responses of N to fire influence the function and structure of terrestrial ecosystems in the long term.},

In the current study, the literature on the effects of fire on soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C, and total N, respiration, and N mineralization in mineral soil was reviewed, and the results of a meta-analysis on literature data were reported. Overall, fire significantly increased the soil total N, microbial biomass N, dissolved organic C, and total N, but decreased soil organic C, microbial biomass C, respiration and N mineralization. Among the significant effects of different fire types, wildfire had the higher effects on the soil organic C, total N, microbial biomass C and N, dissolved total N and respiration of soil than prescribed fire. In addition, responses of soil organic C, total N and N mineralization to wildfire depended on forest type and natural zone. Positive responses of soil organic C, total N were found in broadleaved forests and Mediterranean zones, and negative responses in coniferous forests and temperate zones. Wildfire significantly decreased N mineralization in coniferous forests. The effects of fire on soil microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic C and N mineralization generally decreased with time after the fire. In general, the effects of fire on soil organic C, microbial biomass C, and dissolved total N and N mineralization decreased with increasing soil depth. These results suggest that fire increases C and N availability and increases microbial activity, which consequently decreases the potential rates of C sequestration.},

A custom-made combustion chamber was used to simulate the open burning of crop residues and investigate the impacts of rBC size and mixing state on the particles' optical properties. Average rBC mass median diameters ranged from 141 to 162 nm for the rBC produced from different types of crop residues. The number fraction of thickly-coated rBC varied from 53 to 64\%, suggesting that a majority of the freshly emitted rBC were internally mixed. By comparing the result of observed mass absorption cross-section to that calculated with Mie theory, large light absorption enhancement factors (1.7–1.9) were found for coated particles relative to uncoated cores. These effects were strongly positively correlated with the percentage of coated particles but independent of rBC core size. We suggest that rBC from open biomass burning may have strong impact on air pollution and radiative forcing immediately after their production.},

    Prescribed fire killed Fender's blue larvae. However, fecundity was higher relative to reference/unburned areas for 2 years after the burn and overwinter larval survivorship was higher for a year after the burn. Fire treatments did not influence adult movement behaviour.
    We used matrix models to project butterfly population dynamics in fire‐driven successional landscapes. We compared optimal burn strategies given targeted burns, such as prescribed fire, to undirected burns, such as wildfires. Disturbance enhances population growth rate under both strategies, and the optimal proportion of landscape burned is similar in both cases. However, targeted burning leads to substantially higher population growth rates.
    Synthesis and applications. Demographic models allow planning of long‐term and large‐scale disturbance by balancing initial costs of disturbance with subsequent benefits. We use matrix models to project population growth in fire‐driven successional landscapes and contrast prescribed burns with undirected burns (wildfires). We also use these models to evaluate the influence of local vs. non‐local dispersal. Because random (non‐local) dispersal allows individuals to disperse into areas that were just burned, non‐local dispersal always increases population growth rates in this system. This contrasts with source‐sink dynamics in stationary environments, in which local dispersal leads to higher population growth rates. Our matrix modelling approach has broad application to other disturbance‐dependent taxa surviving in anthropogenically modified landscapes, and could be more widely applied to animal populations.},

This fire regime has been implicated in both habitat alteration and losses of biodiversity. Granivorous birds are particularly affected because of the effect of fire on grass seed availability. The endemic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) has experienced population declines in recent decades, potentially in response to changed fire regimes. Using breeding data from monitored artificial nest-boxes, this study examined the choice of breeding site by Gouldian finches in response to several attributes of the prevailing fire regime. The fire regime was characterised using remote sensing analysis of annual fire scars. Time since last fire and fire frequency were the most useful predictors of breeding site occupancy. Gouldian finches favoured recently burnt sites (previous dry season), but also sites that were infrequently burnt (return time of 2–3 years). Consequently, under the current regime of many frequent fires, Gouldian finches move among breeding sites and display low seasonal site fidelity. Our findings provide support for the notion that the Gouldian finch favours a fine-grain patch-mosaic fire regime and that contemporary large-scale fire regimes are likely contributing to their decline.},

  abstract     = {Fire is a pervasive feature of the tropical savannas of northern Australia. Increasingly extensive and intensive fires have had an adverse effect on grass layer diversity. Reduced grass species diversity and abundance are important correlates of the decline of granivores in these tropical savannas. The Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), an endangered species that is endemic to northern Australia, is particularly vulnerable to changes to the grass layer as its diet comprises only grass seed, and it relies mostly on Sorghum stipoideum during the breeding season. Although this annual grass species is abundant at breeding sites, the finches do not always choose to breed at these sites, raising the possibility that seed quality may vary from year to year. This study examines the effect of fire (time since last fire; fire frequency) on soil fertility and seed nutritional quality. We hypothesise that recently burnt sites produce a flush of soil nutrients and Sorghum stipoideum seed at these sites is of higher nutritional quality. Furthermore, we posit that frequently burnt sites become depleted of soil nutrients and their seeds are of lower nutritional quality. There was a significant increase in inorganic nitrogen in soils following a fire, but no notable change in other soil nutrients. Contingent on this increase in soil inorganic nitrogen, seed nutrient levels, particularly essential proteins, were greater at sites that were recently, but infrequently burnt. Fires appear to affect soil nitrogen and in turn seed nutrition, providing a plausible explanation for why Gouldian finches choose recently, but infrequently burnt breeding sites.},

  abstract    = {The National Wildfire Coordinating Group definition of extreme fire behavior (EFB) indicates a level of fire behavior characteristics that ordinarily precludes methods of direct control action. One or more of the following is usually involved: high rate of spread, prolific crowning/spotting, presence of fire whirls, and strong convection column. Predictability is difficult because such fires often exercise some degree of influence on their environment and behave erratically, sometimes dangerously. Alternate terms include “blow up” and “fire storm.” Fire managers examining fires over the last 100 years have come to understand many of the factors necessary for EFB development. This work produced guidelines included in current firefighter training, which presents the current methods of predicting EFB by using the crown fire model, which is based on the environmental influences of weather, fuels, and topography. Current training does not include the full extent of scientific understanding. Material in current training programs is also not the most recent scientific knowledge. National Fire Plan funds have sponsored newer research related to wind profiles’ influence on fire behavior, plume growth, crown fires, fire dynamics in live fuels, and conditions associated with vortex development. Of significant concern is that characteristic features of EFB depend on conditions undetectable on the ground, relying fundamentally on invisible properties such as wind shear or atmospheric stability. Obviously no one completely understands all the factors contributing to EFB because of gaps in our knowledge. These gaps, as well as the limitations as to when various models or indices apply should be noted to avoid application where they are not appropriate or warranted. This synthesis will serve as a summary of existing extreme fire behavior knowledge for use by fire managers, firefighters, and fire researchers. The objective of this project is to synthesize existing EFB knowledge in a way that connects the weather, fuel, and topographic factors that contribute to development of EFB. This synthesis will focus on the state of the science, but will also consider how that science is currently presented to the fire management community, including incident commanders, fire behavior analysts, incident meteorologists, National Weather Service office forecasters, and firefighters. It will seek to clearly delineate the known, the unknown, and areas of research with the greatest potential impact on firefighter protection.},

These fires often occur in conjunction with Santa Ana weather events, which combine high winds and low humidity, and tend to follow a wet winter rainy season. Because conditions fostering large fall and winter wildfires in California are the result of large-scale patterns in atmospheric circulation, the same dangerous conditions are likely to occur over a wide area at the same time. Furthermore, over a century of watershed reserve management and fire suppression have promoted fuel accumulations, helping to shape one of the most conflagration-prone environments in the world [Pyne, 1997].

Responses of coldwater stream biota to single wildfires are well studied, but measured responses to consecutive wildfires in warmwater systems that often include mixed assemblages of native and nonnative taxa are lacking. We quantified changes in physical habitat, resource availability, and biomass of cold- and warmwater oligochaetes, insects, crayfish, fishes, and tadpoles following consecutive megafires (covering {$>$}100 km2) in the upper Gila River, New Mexico, USA. We were particularly interested in comparing responses of native and nonnative fishes that might have evolved under different disturbance regimes. Changes in habitat and resource availability were related to cumulative fire effects, fire size, and postfire precipitation. The 2nd of 2 consecutive wildfires in the basin was larger and, coupled with moderate postfire discharge, resulted in increased siltation and decreased algal biomass. Several insect taxa responded to these fires with reduced biomass, whereas oligochaete biomass was unaffected. Biomass of 6 of 7 native fish species decreased after the fires, and decreases were associated with site proximity to fire. Nonnative fish decreases after fire were most pronounced for coldwater salmonids, and warmwater nonnative fishes exhibited limited responses. All crayfish and tadpoles collected were nonnative and were unresponsive to fire disturbance. More pronounced responses of native insects and fishes to fires indicate that increasing fire size and frequency threatens the persistence of native fauna and suggests that management activities promoting ecosystem resilience might help ameliorate wildfire effects.},

  abstract     = {Aim Current weaknesses of diversity theory include: a failure to distinguish different biogeographical response variables under the general heading of diversity; and a general failure of ecological theory to deal adequately with geographical scale. Our aim is to articulate the case for a top-down approach to theory building, in which scale is addressed explicitly and in which different response variables are clearly distinguished. Location The article draws upon both theoretical contributions and empirical analyses from all latitudes, focusing on terrestrial ecosystems and with some bias towards (woody) plants. Methods We review current diversity theory and terminology in relation to scale of applicability. As a starting point in developing a general theory, we take the issue of geographical gradients in species richness as a main theme and evaluate the extent to which commonly cited theories are likely to operate at scales from the macro down to the local. Results A degree of confusion surrounds the use of the terms alpha, beta and gamma diversity, and the terms local, landscape and macro-scale are preferred here as a more intuitive framework. The distinction between inventory and differentiation diversity is highlighted as important as, in terms of scale of analysis, are the concepts of focus and extent. The importance of holding area constant in analysis is stressed, as is the notion that different environmental factors exhibit measurable heterogeneity at different scales. Evaluation of several of the most common diversity theories put forward for the grand clines in species richness, indicates that they can be collapsed to dynamic hypotheses based on climate or historical explanations. The importance of the many ecological/biological mechanisms that have been proposed is evident mainly at local scales of analysis, whilst at the macro-scale they are dependent largely upon climatic controls for their operation. Local communities have often been found not to be saturated, i.e. to be non-equilibrial. This is argued, perhaps counter-intuitively, to be entirely compatible with the persistence through time of macro-scale patterns of richness that are climatically determined. The review also incorporates recent developments in macroecology, Rapoport’s rule, trade-offs, and the importance of isolation, landscape impedance and geometric constraints on richness (the mid-domain effect) in generating richness patterns; highlighting those phenomena that are contributory to the first-order climatic pattern, and those, such as the geometric constraints, that may confound or obscure these patterns. Main conclusions A general theory of diversity must necessarily cover many disparate phenomena, at various scales of analysis, and cannot therefore be expressed in a simple formula, but individual elements of this general theory may be. In particular, it appears possible to capture in a dynamic climate-based model and ‘capacity rule’, the form of the grand cline in richness of woody plants at the macro-scale. This provides a starting point for a top-down, global-to-local, macro-to-micro scale approach to modelling richness variations in a variety of taxa. Patterns in differentiation/endemicity, on the other hand, require more immediate attention to historical events, and to features of geography such as isolation. Thus, whilst we argue that there are basic physical principles and laws underlying certain diversity phenomena (e.g. macro-scale richness gradients), a pluralistic body of theory is required that incorporates dynamic and historical explanation, and which bridges equilibrial and nonequilibrial concepts and ideas.},

  abstract     = {We studied how variations in ®re severity and the degree of cutting before burning affected soil invertebrates in a Pinus sylvestris forest in central Sweden. A varied depth of burn in the mor layer was obtained by exclusion of rain and addition of fuel in small plots (1 mÂ2 m) in clear-cut, selectively cut and uncut part of the forest before large-scale prescribed burning took place. Soil samples were taken from the plots immediately before, the day after, and two months after the ®re. The overall mortality of invertebrates depended on the proportion of organic soil consumed by the ®re, and for individual taxa it ranged between 59 and 100\%. Invertebrates that lived deeper in soil suffered lesser mortality than those in the vegetation and litter layers did. Greater mobility in soil (Staphylinidae) or a thick cuticle (Oribatediae, Elateridae) may have contributed to the higher survival observed in these taxa. The beetles Atomaria pulchra (Cryptophagidae), Corticaria rubripes (Lathridiidae), and other ®re-favoured insects colonised the burned forest the very day the ®re burned. These species preferred the hardburned plots and the uncut stand for colonisation. Sixty days after the ®re, the abundance of invertebrates was lower in the burned cut stands compared to the burned uncut stand. The species composition of beetles in the burned stands was then characterised by a few very abundant ®re-favoured species. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Several boreal wood-living insect species breed exclusively in recently burned forest. However, the reason for this dependence on fire is largely unknown. Here wood-living insects and other arthropods were sampled from burned and unburned logs of birch and spruce in a burned forest, together with unburned logs at a clearing and in an uncut forest, during two years of succession after tree death. Burned spruce logs hosted fewer beetles than unburned logs. Notably, bark-beetles and their associated fauna, responded negatively to fire-scorching of the logs while arthropods that feed on ascomycete fungi responded positively. Fire-scorched logs more often had visible ascomycete fungi, and lost their bark faster than unburned logs. However, despite this obvious effect of fire-scorching of the logs, the species composition in burned and unburned logs at the burned site was more similar than in unburned logs at the three different sites. A larger diversity of beetles, when measured with rarefaction, was found for fire-scorched logs. When sites were compared, birch logs had the most diverse fauna at the burned site and spruce logs in the uncut forest. Pyrophilous insect species were almost exclusively confined to the burned forest, but occurred in both burned and unburned logs. These species may be divided into two groups: (1) mycophagous species that need burned substrate per se because ascomycete fungi are favoured by burning, and (2) phloem-feeders and predators that are favoured by some habitat characteristic of recently burned forest rather than of burned wood.},

Tracking animals over large temporal and spatial scales has revealed invaluable and spectacular biological information, particularly when the paths and fates of individuals can be monitored on a global scale. However, only large animals (greater than ∼300 g) currently can be followed globally because of power and size constraints on the tracking devices. And yet the vast majority of animals is small. Tracking small animals is important because they are often part of evolutionary and ecological experiments, they provide important ecosystem services and they are of conservation concern or pose harm to human health. Here, we propose a small-animal satellite tracking system that would enable the global monitoring of animals down to the size of the smallest birds, mammals (bats), marine life and eventually large insects. To create the scientific framework necessary for such a global project, we formed the ICARUS initiative (www.IcarusInitiative.org), the International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space. ICARUS also highlights how small-animal tracking could address some of the `Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences' identified by the US National Academy of Sciences, such as the spread of infectious diseases or the relationship between biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. Small-animal tracking would allow the quantitative assessment of dispersal and migration in natural populations and thus help solve enigmas regarding population dynamics, extinctions and invasions. Experimental biologists may find a global small-animal tracking system helpful in testing, validating and expanding laboratory-derived discoveries in wild, natural populations. We suggest that the relatively modest investment into a global small-animal tracking system will pay off by providing unprecedented insights into both basic and applied nature.
Tracking small animals over large spatial and temporal scales could prove to be one of the most powerful techniques of the early 21st century, offering potential solutions to a wide range of biological and societal questions that date back two millennia to the Greek philosopher Aristotle's enigma about songbird migration. Several of the more recent Grand Challenges in Environmental Sciences, such as the regulation and functional consequences of biological diversity or the surveillance of the population ecology of zoonotic hosts, pathogens or vectors, could also be addressed by a global small-animal tracking system.
Our discussion is intended to contribute to an emerging groundswell of scientific support to make such a new technological system happen.},

  abstract     = {In a landscape-scale experiment, fires were lit in replicate catchments 15-20 km2 in area, either early in the dry season (June) or late in the dry season (September) between 1990 and 1994. For each fire, Byram-intensity was determined in representative one ha areas of Eucalyptus miniata – E. tetrodonta open-forest, with a ground stratum dominated by annual grasses. Fuel weights were measured by harvest, fuel heat content was assumed to be constant, and the rate of spread was determined using electronic timers. Fuels consisted primarily of grass and leaf litter, and ranged from 1.5 to 13 t ha-1; in most years, average fuel loads were 2-4 t ha-1. Rates of spread were generally in the range of 0.2-0.8 ms-1. The mean intensity of early dry season fires (2100 kW m-1) was significantly less than that of the late dry season fires (7700 kW m-1), primarily because, in the late dry season, there was more leaf litter, fuels were drier, and fire weather was more extreme. Crown fires, a feature of forest fires of high intensity in southeastern Australia, were not observed in the Kapalga fires. Fire intensity was a very good predictor of both leaf-char height and leaf-scorch height for fires between 100 kW m-1 and 10,000 kW m-1, the range in which the majority of experimental fires fell.},

  abstract = {Increasing trends in wildfire activity on semi-arid rangelands necessitate advancement in understanding of fire impacts on vegetation, soils, and runoff and erosion processes. This study used artificially applied rainfall and concentrated overland flow experiments to evaluate the ecohydrologic response and recovery of a semi-arid shrubland in the Great Basin Region, USA, following fire. Rainfall experiments were conducted at the 0.5m2 plot scale to assess fire impacts on rainsplash and sheetflow processes. Concentrated flow experiments were applied on 9m2 plots to evaluate fire impacts on concentrated overland flow processes. Vegetation, soil, hydrologic, and erosion variables were assessed at each scale pre-fire and 1, 2, and 5yr post-fire. Infiltration and runoff on rainfall simulation plots were affected more by measured background soil water repellency than fire effects on vegetation and soils. Runoff from rainfall on shrub-dominated plots was unchanged 1yr post-fire, but runoff from interspace plots between shrubs declined 1yr post-fire. Runoff increased on shrub and interspace rainfall plots 2yr post-fire and then declined in the 5yr post-fire. Bare ground generally declined across study years, implicating the temporal variability in soil water repellency as the causal factor for infiltration and runoff trends. Erosion on rainfall plots increased by factors of 8 to more than 10 following fire removal of vegetation and ground cover and declined with vegetation recovery through five growing seasons. Concentrated overland flow plots generated slightly more total runoff and 26-fold more total sediment 1yr following burning relative to pre-fire measures. Erosion from concentrated overland flow remained greater on burned than unburned plots after five growing seasons even though ground cover returned to approximately 85\%. The relative recovery of vegetation and total ground cover were typical for the shrubland community assessed, but elevated erosion with 85\% ground cover 5yr post-fire was unexpected. The persistent high sediment delivery from concentrated plots is attributed to the fine textured soils and thin litter accumulation. The importance of considering erodibility in context with sediment supply and vegetative recovery is discussed. The results demonstrate the complexity of post-fire ecohydrologic interactions, advance process understanding of post-fire ecohydrologic responses for semi-arid rangelands, and underscore the need for additional studies on post-fire recovery over time.},

The primary objective was to assess differences in fire intensity and smoke plume area between prescribed fires and wildfires around Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. We matched thermal anomaly satellite data to databases of fires in forests surrounding both cities. For each matched fire we determined hotspot count and quantified their intensity using the fire radiative power (FRP) measurement. Smoke plumes were mapped using MODIS true colour images. Wildfires had more extreme fire intensity values than did prescribed burns and the mean size of wildfire plumes was six times greater than of prescribed fire plumes for both cities. Statistical modelling showed that the horizontal area covered by smoke plumes could be predicted by hotspot count and sum of FRP, with differences between cities and fire type. Smoke plumes from both fire types reached both urban areas, and particulate pollution was higher on days affected by smoke plumes. Our results suggested that prescribed fires produced smaller smoke plume areas than did wildfires in two different flammable landscapes. Smoke plume and FRP data, combined with air pollution data from static monitors, can be used to improve smoke management for human health.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed burning is used to reduce the occurrence, extent and severity of uncontrolled fires in many flammable landscapes. However, epidemiologic evidence of the human health impacts of landscape fire smoke emissions is shaping fire management practice through increasingly stringent environmental regulation and public health policy. An unresolved question, critical for sustainable fire management, concerns the comparative human health effects of smoke from wild and prescribed fires. Here we review current knowledge of the health effects of landscape fire emissions and consider the similarities and differences in smoke from wild and prescribed fires with respect to the typical combustion conditions and fuel properties, the quality and magnitude of air pollution emissions, and the potential for dispersion to large populations. We further examine the interactions between these considerations, and how they may shape the longer term smoke regimes to which populations are exposed. We identify numerous knowledge gaps and propose a conceptual framework that describes pathways to better understanding of the health trade-offs of prescribed and wildfire smoke regimes.},

We compared physicochemical variables and community structure of burned and unburned headwater streams. Sampling began shortly after the fire was extinguished and comprised periodic water quality assessments and four visits to collect periphyton and invertebrate samples (May, August, October and December). Water temperature, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids and specific conductance were significantly higher in burned sites, whereas nutrient and oxygen concentrations exhibited no major differences. Chlorophyll a (used as a surrogate for autotrophic periphyton biomass) also did not differ significantly. Macroinvertebrate richness, abundance and diversity showed no differences across sites, but taxonomic composition and densities of sensitive taxa were markedly lower at burned streams. Oligochaetes and amphipods, however, were significantly more abundant in the disturbed reaches. Analysis of functional feeding groups revealed that the relative abundances of shredders and collector-filterers were lower at burned sites, possibly reflecting a shift in detrital input.},

We experimentally compared species diversity decline between nine-species grassland communities under field conditions to test whether diversity maintenance mechanisms differed between communities containing all exotic or all native species using a pool of 40 species. Aboveground biomass was greater in exotic than native plots, and this difference was larger in mixtures than in monocultures. Species diversity declined more in exotic than native communities and declines were explained by different mechanisms. In exotic communities, overyielding species had high biomass in monoculture and diversity declined linearly as this selection effect increased. In native communities, however, overyielding species had low biomass in monoculture and there was no relationship between the selection effect and diversity decline. This suggests that, for this system, yielding behaviour is fundamentally different between presumably co-evolved natives and coevolutionarily naive exotic species, and that native-exotic status is important to consider.},

  abstract     = {Identifying relationships between habitat selection and population processes is important for habitat management and wildlife conservation. For prairie-obligate species, space use and demography in extant grasslands are influenced by habitat conditions caused by rangeland management practices associated with livestock production. Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) are an indicator species for native tallgrass prairie ecosystems, but populations have declined in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas, USA because of intensification of rangeland management practices, including annual prescribed fire and high stocking densities. Patch-burn grazing is a rotational system that provides heterogeneous habitats and can improve productivity of grassland birds, but the effects of grazing systems on habitat use or survival of greater prairie-chickens are unknown. We used 3 types of survival analyses to investigate impacts of rangeland management on female greater prairie-chickens in the central Flint Hills during 2011?2013: Kaplan?Meier models and Cox proportional hazards to examine factors affecting annual survival rates, hazard functions to assess seasonal patterns of mortality, and Andersen?Gill models to explore the links between habitat selection and cause-specific mortality risk. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing had annual survival rates (0.61?±?0.07?SE) that were 35\% higher than females on properties managed with annual burning and intensive early cattle stocking (0.45?±?0.06). Moreover, females that selected habitats associated with intensive management had increased mortality risk and were particularly vulnerable to avian predators, whereas females that selected habitats created by patch-burn grazing experienced lower overall mortality risk but were more vulnerable to mammalian predators. Overall mortality risk was significantly reduced under patch-burn grazing management, and widespread implementation of annual spring burning and intensive early stocking is likely depressing survival of greater prairie-chickens in the Flint Hills ecoregion. Our results join a growing body of evidence that patch-burn grazing can provide higher quality grassland habitats for native wildlife species than current rangeland management associated with intensive cattle production.},

  abstract = {On all inhabited continents, wildfires are important ecological disturbances that influence water resources. As an exemplar of this global phenomenon, wildfire activity in the western United states increased in the 1980s and has continued to trend upward in subsequent decades. However, the hydrologic impact of wildfire has been difficult to ascertain at a continental scale due to the complexity of processes that influence critical zone dynamics. We calibrated Fuh’s equation to wildfire-impacted gauged watersheds and used the validated model to retrospectively quantify the proportion of streamflow attributed to wildfire hydrologic impacts from 1986 to 2015 across ungauged watersheds, accounting for interwatershed variability in water retention capacity and climate as well as how these factors interact with burned area and postwildfire vegetation recovery. Here we show that in parts of the western United States with high proportion of area burned by fire, wildfire-linked streamflow accounts for as much as 20\% of streamflow, rivaling or exceeding predicted climate change impacts. This analytic framework demonstrates that over a multidecadal period, the present trajectory of rising temperatures and increases in large wildfires may enhance the regional-scale importance of wildfires in streamflow generation, thereby partially offsetting projected streamflow reductions due to rising temperatures and evaporative demand.},

  abstract     = {Ash formed by the combustion of vegetation and the litter and duff layers may affect runoff and erosion rates in the period immediately following wildfires, but only a handful of studies have specifically measured its effect. Approximately 1 month after the 2005 Tarkio Fire in western Montana, we applied simulated rainfall for 1 h at a mean intensity of 7.5 cm h−1 to six pairs of 0.5-m2 plots in an area burned at high severity and with a continuous 1-cm to 3.5-cm ash layer on the surface. The ash was retained in one plot per pair and removed from the other plot with a fine brush. The ash layer provided an additional 1.5 cm of water storage capacity and protected the underlying mineral soil from surface sealing, so that the time of ponding in the ash-covered plots was 12 ± 10 min longer, the final runoff rate was 2.1 ± 0.4 cm h−1 lower and the total infiltration was 2.0 ± 1.2 cm higher than in the plots without ash. The reduced runoff from the ash-covered plots in combination with reduced rainsplash detachment resulted in a 74\% reduction in sediment yield relative to the plots without ash. Nine months after the fire, the ash was patchy and just a few millimetres thick, and a second set of simulations showed no significant differences in the time of ponding, final runoff rate, total infiltration or sediment yield between plots with and without ash. Ash may significantly reduce the runoff and erosion from severely burned areas in the period shortly after a fire. Consequently, the largest post-fire hydrogeomorphic hazard will occur after the ash layer has been removed by wind and water erosion, but before there has been substantial vegetative regrowth.},

  abstract     = {Eruptive fire is a typical extreme fire behavior in wildland fuels, characterized by a sudden acceleration of fire spread over confined slopes in trench-like terrain (e.g. in a deep canyon). However, wildfire spread acceleration in trench configuration has received little study. This paper presents a systematic experimental study on the fire spread over a pine needle fuel bed in an inclined trench. The effects of aspect ratio (ratio of the trench side wall height to the trench width) and slope angle on the fire spread behaviors are investigated. It is indicated that flame attachment toward the fuel bed surface is induced by the combined effects of the slope and the air entrainment restriction due to the trench configuration. The flame attachment occurring at higher slopes with higher aspect ratios induces an acceleration of fire spread, causing the fire spread to undergo a rapid transition from a steady phase with lower rate of spread (ROS) to quick spread phase with much higher ROS. The fire spread acceleration induced by the flame attachment leads to remarkable enhancement of burning intensity, as verified by long flame depth and high mass loss rate during fire spread. The fuel consumption efficiency decreases almost linearly with increasing slope angle. Under higher slope angles (higher than 20◦ in this work) the flame tilting induces hot gas flow ahead of the flame front, which enhances the convective heating. When flame attachment occurs, the spatial influence range of convective heating increases sharply. It is concluded that for eruptive fire, radiative heating and convective heating play a comparable role in fuel preheating. Experimental data suggest that when flame attachment occurs the convective heating is greatly enhanced and becomes an important mechanism of fuel preheating. This is inferred to be a major potential mechanism for eruptive fire in trench configuration.},

Contemporary research is revealing new questions outside the bounds of this simplified approach. Here, we explore the complex interactions taking place beyond steady-state assumptions through acknowledging the manufactured separation of research disciplines in fire science and the dynamic interactions that unfold when these separations are removed. Through a series of examples spanning at least four research disciplines and three ranges of spatial scale, we illustrate that by precisely defining parameters in a way that holds across scales and relaxing one steady-state simplification, we begin to capture the inherent variability that has largely eluded the fire behavior community. Through exploring examples of “deep interdependence,” we make the case that fire behavior science is well equipped to launch forward into more complex lines of inquiry.},

This article focuses on a specific issue: the affective dimension of news media coverage immediately following a crisis. The selection and presentation of bushfire stories not only disseminates information but elicits emotion from audiences. I use textual and visual analysis of The Age newspaper’s coverage of the 2009 Victorian bushfires to examine the discursive structuring of affect. Comparisons are made with coverage of earlier bushfire disasters (the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires and the 1939 Black Friday fires) in order to investigate changes in the visual and verbal discourses of bushfire reporting. The article demonstrates that there is an intensification of affect in contemporary media coverage that is not present in the coverage of previous bushfires, and that this has implications for the role of the emotions in public life and for our conception of the public sphere.},

  abstract     = {Aim To compare fire behaviour and fire management practice at a site managed continuously by traditional Aboriginal owners with other sites in tropical northern Australia, including the nearby Kakadu National Park, and relate those observations to indicators of landscape condition. Location Dukaladjarranj, a clan estate in north-central Arnhem Land, in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. The site abuts a vast sandstone plateau that is an internationally recognized centre of plant and animal biodiversity. Methods Ecological assessments included: (1) mapping of the resource base of the estate from both traditional and ecological perspectives; (2) aerial survey of the extent of burning, distribution of the fire-sensitive native pine Callitris intratropica, rock habitats, and a range of macropod and other fauna resources; (3) fauna inventory; (4) detailed ecological assessment of the status of fire-sensitive vegetation; and (5) empirical assessment of the intensities of experimental fires. Ethnographic information concerning traditional fire management practice was documented in interviews with senior custodians. Results Experimental fires lit during the study were of low intensity compared with late dry season fires reported elsewhere, despite weather conditions favouring rapid combustion. In contrast to other parts of the savanna, fuel loads comprised mostly leaf litter and little grass. We found that (i) a large proportion of the estate had been burned during the year of the study (ii) burned sites attracted important animal food resources such as large macropods (iii) important plant foods remained abundant (iv) well represented in the landscape were fire sensitive vegetation types (e.g. Callitris intratropica Baker \& Smith woodlands) and slow growing sandstone ‘heath’ typically dominated by myrtaceaous and proteaceous shrubs (v) diversity of vertebrate fauna was high, including rare or range-restricted species (vi) exotic plants were all but absent. Traditional practice includes regular, smaller fires, lit throughout the year, and cooperation with neighbouring clans in planning and implementing burning regimes. Main conclusions We attribute the ecological integrity of the site to continued human occupation and maintenance of traditional fire management practice, which suppresses otherwise abundant annual grasses (Sorghum spp.) and limits accumulation of fuels in perennial grasses (Triodia spp.) or other litter. Suppression of fuels and coordination of fire use combine to greatly reduce wildfire risk and to produce and maintain diverse habitats. Aboriginal people derive clear economic benefits from this style of management, as evidenced by abundant and diverse animal and plant foods. However, the motives for the Aboriginal management system are complex and include the fulfillment of social and religious needs, a factor that remains important to Aboriginal people despite the rapid and ongoing transformation of their traditional lifestyles. The implication of this study is that the maintenance of the biodiversity of the Arnhem Land plateau requires intensive, skilled management that can be best achieved by developing co-operative programmes with local indigenous communities.},

To use this practice successfully, managers must understand the seasonal windows within which prescribed fire can be applied and how fire behavior could potentially vary among these windows. To characterize prescribed fire windows within the northern Great Plains of North America, we collected data from 20 remote weather stations positioned across North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, USA, from station inception to 2015. We performed an hourly analysis for each station to determine if air temperature (2 to 43 °C), relative humidity (25 to 80\%), and wind speed (6.44 to 24.12 km h−\,1) conditions were within acceptable ranges for at least six contiguous precipitation-free hours from 0800 to 1800 h. We summarized acceptable conditions over five half-season windows and then used the Rothermel fire spread equation to simulate fire behavior within these half-season windows based on average, minimum, and maximum conditions for seasonally appropriate live herbaceous to fine dead fuel ratios.},

Conditions in one Absaroka Range stream that was severely burned in 1988 were compared to those in an adjacent, undisturbed stream to improve understanding of fire effects on channel and LWD characteristics beyond the first few years. Ten reaches of each stream were sampled during summer 1999. Average bankfull channel width was greater in burned Jones Creek than in unburned Crow Creek. LWD frequency and overall frequency of LWD accumulations were greater in Crow Creek than Jones Creek. Debris-jam frequency was greater in Jones Creek after accounting for differences in the frequency of pieces with length greater than channel width. Larger piece size and better anchoring contributed to more frequent, small accumulations of LWD in Crow Creek. Differences between streams in LWD frequency are consistent with greater mobility of debris in burned Jones Creek. LWD-associated fine-sediment deposits were thicker but less frequent along Jones Creek than Crow Creek.},

  abstract     = {Perennial grasses are a dominant component of many vegetation formations and provide important ecosystem services including supporting herbivores and preventing soil erosion. Despite their importance, our understanding of the processes that influence their mortality rates is surprisingly limited. This study explores the effects of local and landscape-scale processes on mortality of a perennial grass (Stipagrostis uniplumis) in semi-arid savanna. We focussed on three local-scale factors: self-shading by the standing dead biomass of a tuft, plant size, and neighbour abundance as a measure of intra-specific competition. Three indices of neighbour abundance were calculated: number of neighbours, sum of the neighbours’ basal area, and sum of the neighbours’ living basal area. At the landscape scale, we explored the influence of fire on tuft mortality. The amount of standing dead biomass increased the mortality rates of tufts. Neighbour abundance, indexed as the sum of the living basal area of neighbours, was also associated with higher mortality rates, whereas the other indices of neighbour abundance had no influence on mortality rates. On a landscape level, fire significantly increased tuft mortality rates, from up to 31\% for unburned tufts, to 73\% for burned tufts. Fire, on the other hand, indirectly reduces the risk of future mortality by reducing self-shading and competitive pressure. Our results imply that the timing and frequency of fires is crucial for their positive indirect effects on plant fitness. As the onset of local effects on plant mortality is highly dependent on grazing pressure and stochastic rainfall, fire management should flexibly take into account the accumulation of dead plant material on a site.},

In this study, we found that from 2002 to 2016 burned area in Africa declined by 18.5\%, with the strongest decline (80\% of the area) in the Northern Hemisphere. One third of the reduction in burned area occurred in croplands, suggesting that changes in agricultural practices (including cropland expansion) are not the predominant factor behind recent changes in fire extent.

Our results provide evidence that despite the fact that most fires are human-caused in Africa, increased terrestrial moisture during 2002–2016 facilitated declines in fire activity in Africa.},

Prompted by a series of increasingly destructive, expensive, and highly visible wildfire crises in human communities across the globe, a robust body of scholarship has emerged to theorize, conceptualize, and measure community-level resilience to wildfires. To date, however, insufficient consideration has been given to wildfire resilience as a process of adaptive governance mediated by institutions at multiple scales. Here we explore the possibilities for addressing this gap through an analysis of wildfire resilience among wildland-urban interface communities in the western region of the United States. We re-engage important but overlooked components of social-ecological system resilience by situating rural communities within their state- to national-level institutional contexts; we then analyze two communities in Nevada and New Mexico in terms of their institutional settings and responses to recent wildfire events. We frame our analysis around the concepts of scale matching, linking within and across scales, and institutional flexibility.},

Our findings drawn from case studies of four associations in Idaho and Oregon suggest that the Rangeland Fire Protection Association model presents opportunities to leverage the motivations, skills, and knowledge of ranchers to inform effective fire response and create opportunities for learning and adaptation. At the same time, this model of coproduction presents challenges to the integration of formal and informal institutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper discusses participatory processes in wildland fire management (WFM). Participation is an essential element of both the European Sustainable Development (SD) Strategy and the White Paper on Governance. Governance and SD have thus become an interconnected challenge to be applied to WFM (as a sub-area in forest policy), amongst other policies. An overspread weakness in WFM is lack of real participation of stakeholders. Absence of (or deficient) participation can seriously impair contribution of this group to WFM in high-risk areas and runs counter governance and the SDS. Further, this weakness might prevent an efficient use of fire as a land management tool (prescribed burning, PB) and as a technique for fighting wildfire (suppression fire, SF). Even though these fire practices have been well known in many different places, they have been increasingly neglected or prohibited over time in Southern Europe. At present, forest and fire fighting administrations are turning their eyes back on them and analyzing the benefits of using fire in relation to preventive and suppressive actions. Therefore, participatory and diffusion mechanisms (the latter adopting the shape of national and international experts’ networks) are required in order to solve the socalled fire paradox: that is, the need to move from a one-dimensional perception of the negative impacts of fire to a more sophisticated one that also stresses its positive effects. Governance, based on broad social participation, and diffusion, through fire networks, are of utmost importance in order, first, to diminish long-standing suspicion amongst different interests as to the use of fire and, secondly, to diffuse best practices associated with PB and SF. Most importantly, the EU should exercise its environmental leadership so that these new fire practices and sustainable WFM are diffused across the international arena.},

Outsiders are eager to gain access, and the community has devised a set of rules to allow them in. Because Seri government officials keep all the economic benefits generated from granting this access for themselves, community members create alternative entry mechanisms to divert those benefits to themselves. Under Hardin's model of the tragedy of the commons, this situation would eventually lead to the overexploitation of the fishery. The Seri people, however, are able to simultaneously maintain access and use controls for the continuing sustainability of their fishing grounds. Using insights from common-pool resources theory, I discuss how Seri community characteristics help mediate the conflict between collective action dilemmas and access and use controls.},

Although traditionally used as a widespread land management tool in the past, its continued use could be under threat due to public perceptions pertaining to risks from burns getting out of control, as well as the impacts of smoke pollution and ecological damage. To determine the attitudes of rural practitioners and residents toward use of fire as a land management tool, this paper reports the results, analysis, and interpretation to a survey question: “Do you feel fire is a good option for managing rural land?”, along with an analysis of key attitudes toward the use of fire as a land management tool. The survey was undertaken with 696 respondents consisting of (rural land managers, rural populace, and rural fire personnel) within New Zealand. The survey identified differing perceptions about the suitability of prescribed fire use by land-based sectors. Five constructs explained the attitudes toward use of fire as a land management tool: benefits of fire use, the tradition of fire as a tool, regulations and liabilities, smoke impacts from fire, and the risks from knowledge loss and changing land use. Results showed that a person’s high agreement with the construct concerning negative smoke impacts resulted in less agreement that fire was a good option for use in rural land management in New Zealand. Main demographics influencing a positive attitude toward the use of fire included gender (male), their current use of fire, and larger land area managed. For prescribed fire to continue to be a useful tool, an improved understanding of current management practices and clear guidelines around best practice in using fire in New Zealand to manage land are required, with particular emphasis on limiting smoke impacts.},

This is particularly crucial if large-scale poverty alleviation is to be secured without undermining the capacity of the environment to support future generations. To address this challenge, strategies that enable judicious management of social-ecological systems in the face of substantive uncertainty are needed. Several such strategies are emerging from the developing body of work on complexity and resilience. We identify and discuss four strategies, providing practical examples of how each strategy has been applied in innovative ways to manage turbulent social-ecological change in South Africa and the broader region: (1) employ adaptive management or comanagement, (2) engage and integrate different perspectives, (3) facilitate self-organization, and (4) set safe boundaries to avoid system thresholds. Through these examples we aim to contribute a basis for further theoretical development, new teaching examples, and inspiration for developing innovative new management strategies in other regions that can help address the considerable sustainability challenges facing society globally.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed burning is advocated for the sustainable management of fire-prone ecosystems for its capacity to reduce fuel loads and mitigate large high-intensity wildfires. However, there is a lack of comprehensive field evidence on which to base predictions of the benefits of prescribed burning for meeting either wildfire hazard reduction or conservation goals. Australian eucalypt forests are among the very few forest types in the world where prescribed burning has been practised long enough and at a large enough spatial scale to quantify its effect on the incidence and extent of unplanned fires. Nevertheless even for Australian forests evidence of the effectiveness of prescribed burning remains fragmented and largely unpublished in the scientific literature. We analysed a 52-year fire history from a eucalypt forest region in south-western Australia to quantify the impact of prescribed burning on the incidence, extent and size distribution of wildfires. Quantile regression identified the longevity of the influence of prescribed fire treatments on wildfire incidence and extent. Anomalies in the frequency-size distribution of unplanned fires were identified through a relative risk mapping using kernel density estimates. Changes in the spatial distribution of fuel age were quantified using patch metrics, while generalized additive models were applied to estimate effects of fuel age patterns on the incidence and extent of unplanned fire. Prescribed burning has pronouncedly changed the spatial distribution of fuel age in the study area and has significantly reduced the incidence and extent of unplanned fires. This effect on both the incidence and extent of unplanned fires was minimal for time lags greater than 6 years between fuel treatment and response. When averaged over 6-year periods, the annual extent of prescribed burning explained 24\% and 71\% of the variation in the mean annual number and extent of unplanned fires, respectively. The incidence of large unplanned fires was significantly less than the long-term average for the region when the annual extent of prescribed fire was at a maximum and significantly more when the annual extent of prescribed fire was at a minimum. Since the 1960s, the length of time sites remain unburned by wildfire has approximately doubled to ∼9 years. We found that each unit area reduction in unplanned fire required about four units of prescription fire. These findings concur with the observations of experienced field practitioners who identify the 6-year mark as effective at reducing wildfire hazard. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence of the effectiveness of prescribed burning for mitigating wildfire hazard in SW Australian forests. Ongoing research and development is needed to implement managed fire regimes that integrate wildfire mitigation with conservation of biodiversity and other environmental values.},

Fire is an integral process in many of these ecosystems, and indeed is often necessary for the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and biodiversity. However, fire is increasingly seen as a destructive force, impacting on crops, pastures, forestry plantations, livestock, human habitation and even on human life. The management of wildland fires in post-apartheid South Africa, where the country has been re- united under a single democratic government, calls for new institutional arrangements and a co-ordinated approach. The issue of fire management in South Africa will in future be governed by the new Veld and Forest Fire Act, which was passed into law in 1998. The Act aims to facilitate fire management, through the introduction of measures to combat veld, forest and mountain fires throughout the country and thereby reduce the damage and losses to natural vegetation, life and property. This paper outlines the initial steps that have been taken to implement the Veld and Forest Fire Act.},

The current condition of the forest was the most important factor influencing support/opposition of management strategies for both individualists and non-individualists.

Respondents in different locations differed in their knowledge about fire and fuel issues as well in their acceptability judgments.

  abstract     = {South-west Australia is a region of remarkable biological diversity, predominantly shaped by diversity of climate and geomorphology. Fire has also played an important role in shaping biodiversity over at least 2.5 million years and anthropogenic fire has been a part of this environment for tens of thousands of years. Forest ecosystems are fire-maintained, having evolved traits that enable them to persist with, and depend upon a variety of fire regimes. No single regime is optimal for all organisms and communities, but diverse regimes, within ecological limits, are essential for maintaining biodiversity. Bushfires can also threaten people, property and industry so fire management, including proactive use of fire, is necessary to both conserve biodiversity and to reduce the negative impacts of bushfires. There exists a substantial body of fire ecology literature for these ecosystems. If on-ground fire management is to advance commensurate with advances in fire science, then this often complex plethora of information needs to be synthesized, simplified and presented as practical fire management paradigms, policies and prescriptions. This paper attempts to achieve this by describing a range of evidence-based practical fire regimes that can be implemented to conserve biodiversity and to protect human life and property in south-west Australian forests.},

In this study, we develop a spatially explicit game theoretic model to examine the strategic interaction between landowners’ hazard mitigation decisions on a landscape with public and private ownership. We find that in areas where ownership is mixed, the private landowner performs too little fuel treatment as they “free ride”—capture benefits without incurring the costs—on public protection, while areas with public land only are under-protected. Our central result is that this pattern of fuel treatment comes at a cost to society because public resources focus in areas with mixed ownership, where local residents capture the benefits, and are not available for publicly managed land areas that create benefits for society at large. We also find that policies that encourage public expenditures in areas with mixed ownership, such as the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003 and public liability for private values, subsidize the residents who choose to locate in the high-risk areas at the cost of lost natural resource benefits for others.},

The syntax of the grammar identifies components of institutions and sorts them into three types of institutional statements: rules, norms, and shared strategies.

  abstract     = {Home and contents insurance is integral to household and community resilience against disasters. Yet many households are underinsured. While causes for underinsurance have been widely researched, changes to Australian building regulations in the last decade has established a new source of insurance miscalculations. Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) ratings can inflate rebuilding costs by 20\% or more, yet BAL ratings remain obfuscated to homeowners and are notoriously confusing to navigate. After the October 2013 bushfires in New South Wales, the Blue Mountains Local Recovery Steering Group found that ‘information on the BAL process, the guidelines, the expected costs, the consulting experts and a property’s bushfire-prone status is literally all over the place’. This paper aims to provide clarity on the subject, tracing the precise socio-technical means through which disaster risk is perceived and assessed. The paper conceptualises insurance and risk ratings as calculative devices that provide both a technical solution to reduce financial losses and a philosophical tool for risk rationalisation. It then builds on interviews conducted with residents in the Blue Mountains affected by the 2013 bushfires, to ascertain how such calculative devices practically affect communities at risk. The paper concludes by outlining potential solutions to a confusing and costly problem in Australia, highlighting critical public awareness issues surround BAL ratings, which have profound insurance and wellbeing implications for people rebuilding and recovering from bushfire.},

Wildfires that escape initial suppression often expand into large, high-intensity summer blazes. Lost is the legacy of smaller fires that likely burned outside extreme weather and fuel conditions and resulted in less severe impacts. Despite the recognized need for modifications to existing policies and practices, resource agencies have been slow to respond. The spread of exotic species, climate change, and increasing human development in wildlands further complicates the issue. New policies are needed that integrate social and ecological needs across administrative boundaries and broad landscapes. These policies should promote a continuum of treatments with active management and reduction of fuel hazard in wildland-urban interface zones and reintroduction of fire in wildlands. Management goals should focus on restoration of the long-term ecological health of the land. Projects that reduce fuel loads but compromise the integrity of soil, water supplies, or watersheds will do more harm than good in the long run. Despite significant ecological concerns, learning to live with fire remains primarily a social issue that will require greater political leadership, agency innovation, public involvement, and community responsibility.},

We provide a systematic compilation, review, and quantification of dominant trends in this literature by collecting all empirical research conducted within the U.S. that has addressed perceptions and behaviors surrounding various aspects of prescribed burning and wildfire. We reviewed and quantified this literature using four thematic categories covering: (1) the theory and methods that have been used in previous research; (2) the psychosocial aspects of prescribed burning and wildfire that have been studied; (3) the biophysical characteristics of the fires which have been studied; and (4) the types of fire and management approaches that have been examined. Our integrative review builds on previous literature reviews on the subject by offering new insight on the dominant trends, underutilized approaches, and under-studied topics within each thematic category. For example, we found that a select set of theories (e.g., Protection Motivation Theory, Attribution Theory, etc.) and approaches (e.g., mixed-methods) have only been used sparingly in previous research, even though these theories and approaches can produce insightful results that can readily be implemented by fire-management professionals and decision makers. By identifying trends and gaps in the literature across the thematic categories, we were able to answer four questions that address how future research can make the greatest contribution to our understanding of perceptions and behaviors related to prescribed burning and wildfire.},

However, the notion ‘Whoever owns the fuel owns the fire’ has not been analysed from a legal perspective. This paper reviews Australian law to identify who is legally responsible for fire that starts on privately owned land. We argue that the correct interpretation of existing Australian law is: ‘Whoever owns the ignition owns the fire’ – that is, liability to pay for losses caused by bushfire has always fallen on those that intentionally start a fire, not on the owner of the fuel that sustains the fire. That legal conclusion could have dramatic implications for fire management policies. It will be shown that liability for starting a prescribed burn is clear-cut whereas liability for allowing accumulated fuel loads to contribute to the spread of fire is almost unheard of. As a result, we argue that the law is pushing landowners in a direction away from the policy direction adopted by all Australian governments.

  abstract     = {Shifts in government priorities in response to the 2007 global recession have affected wildfire management and natural disaster funding arrangements, leading to a reduced effectiveness of fire suppression actions and increasing fire vulnerability. Our study investigates the role of local socioeconomic contexts on fire suppression effectiveness under economic expansion and recession in a Mediterranean region (Attica, Greece) strongly affected by 2007 crisis and displaying a persistently high density of peri-urban wildfires. Basic characteristics of wildfires (spatial distribution, intensity, and land use preferences) were investigated in the study area over two consecutive 8-year time intervals characterized by economic expansion (2000–2007) and recession (2008–2015). An integrated approach based on multivariate statistics and artificial neural networks was implemented to evaluate latent relationships between fire suppression time, wildfire characteristics, and socioeconomic dynamics. Controlling for wildfires’ characteristics over the two time intervals, fire time length increased under crisis—mainly for small and medium-sized fires—possibly as an indirect response to reduced effectiveness of forest land management. Local contexts and political decisions influenced by economic downturns are relevant factors shaping wildfires’ severity in the Mediterranean region. With recession, local contexts vulnerable to wildfires require more effective fire prevention measures, sustainable forest management, and regional planning.},

  abstract     = {A simulation system was developed to explore how fuel treatments placed in topologically random and optimal spatial patterns affect the growth and behaviour of large fires when implemented at different rates over the course of five decades. The system consisted of a forest and fuel dynamics simulation module (Forest Vegetation Simulator, FVS), logic for deriving fuel model dynamics from FVS output, a spatial fuel treatment optimisation program, and a spatial fire growth and behaviour model to evaluate the performance of the treatments in modifying large fire growth. Simulations were performed for three study areas: Sanders County in western Montana, the Stanislaus National Forest in California, and the Blue Mountains in south-eastern Washington. For different spatial treatment strategies, the results illustrated that the rate of fuel treatment (percentage of land area treated per decade) competes against the rates of fuel recovery to determine how fuel treatments contribute to multidecade cumulative impacts on the response variables. Using fuel treatment prescriptions that simulate thinning and prescribed burning, fuel treatment arrangements that are optimal in disrupting the growth of large fires require at least 1 to 2\% of the landscape to be treated each year. Randomly arranged units with the same treatment prescriptions require about twice that rate to produce the same fire growth reduction. The results also show that the topological fuel treatment optimisation tends to balance maintenance of previous units with treatment of new units. For example, with 2\% landscape treatment annually, fewer than 5\% of the units received three or more treatments in five decades with most being treated only once or twice and \textasciitilde 35\% remaining untreated after five decades.},

The review concentrates on experiences of adaptive governance of social-ecological systems during periods of abrupt change (crisis) and investigates social sources of renewal and reorganization. Such governance connects individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions at multiple organizational levels. Key persons provide leadership, trust, vision, meaning, and they help transform management organizations toward a learning environment. Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of “bridging organizations” seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts. A resilient social-ecological system may make use of crisis as an opportunity to transform into a more desired state.},

  abstract     = {As Southern California becomes hotter and dryer, wildfires are becoming more frequent and severe. At the same time, the suburbanization of poverty and immigration are making the region increasingly – albeit unevenly - diverse. This paper synthesizes insights from planning and ecology to address the following questions: how do burned areas differ from the rest of the region in terms of poverty, race, and housing values; how has this changed since 1980; and what are the implications for environmental justice? Typically, low-income urban communities of color are disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts. However, this study finds that the wildland-adjacent neighborhoods most impacted by wildfire have remained predominantly white and affluent, even as Southern California has become increasingly diverse. Moreover, housing in burned areas is increasingly more expensive. These results indicate that home ownership in a fire-prone, wildland-adjacent neighborhood is a profitable investment for those who can afford it. This situation is likely creating perverse incentives for continued development of the wildland-urban interface, leading to both continued ecological disturbance and affluent residents continuing to subject themselves to more physical danger than they have acknowledged.},

Retained within collective memory, SDFRN contributed to community resilience by diversifying possible responses to environmental change and uncertainty.

In the global context of both increasing fire severity with climate change and increasing wildland–urban interface area, the use of environmental-based dynamical modelling tools offers a good alternative to better evaluate fire risk. A new method is presented here that combines the raster-based fire spread model SWIFFT and a stochastic approach for generating the spatial and temporal distribution of ignition points. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted, and the uncertainties of hazard and losses are evaluated. Adapted and applied to the landscape conditions of a Brazilian plantation, it is shown to be well suited for a precise reconstruction of the fire burnt area. Finally, the uncertainty assessment of losses for this study zone is presented. We conclude by discussing this new method, which has a high level of traceable uncertainty and how fire risk insurance can deal with it, as well as the progress of future research that will benefit from this method.},

Prescribed fire and grazing are typically used on public reserves to increase biodiversity, improve grassland productivity, and control encroachment of woody plants. However, these tools, particularly prescribed fire, have not been widely adopted by private landowners. Fire suppression and prescribed fire are strategies that present competing risks to owners who make management decisions. We explore landowner perceptions of risk associated with (1) eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) encroachment, and (2) the use of prescribed fire to control woody species in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri, USA. We found that although mapping data of eastern redcedar in this region showed substantial encroachment over the past three decades, concept mapping of landowner beliefs and in-person interviews of local community leaders revealed that perceived risks associated with prescribed fire often outweighed those associated with loss of forage and grassland habitats.},

  abstract     = {We collected data at seven sites in the western US, on the costs of fuel reduction operations (prescribed fire, mechanical treatment, mechanical plus fire), and measured the effects of these treatments on surface fuel and stand parameters. We also modeled the potential behavior of wildfire in the treated and control stands. Gross costs of mechanical treatments were more expensive than those of prescribed fire, but net costs of mechanical treatments after deducting the values of harvested products were, on most sites, less than those of fire. The fire-only treatment reduced surface fuels, while most mechanical treatments (with the probable exception of whole-tree removal) increased these loads. Most mechanical-plus-fire treatments had little net effect on surface fuels. All treatments reduced the number of live trees, on average by about 300, 500 and 700 stems per hectare respectively for fire-only, mechanical, and mechanical-plus-fire. As intended by prescription, the mechanical treatments reduced basal area per hectare significantly. In most cases the fires – either alone or following mechanical treatment – killed mostly small trees, having essentially no impact on basal area. The mechanical-plus-fire treatment was the most effective, followed by fire-only, at reducing the modeled severity of wildfire effects under extreme weather conditions. The effectiveness of mechanical-only treatments depended on how much surface fuel remained on site. A whole-tree harvesting system removed the tops and limbs along with the felled trees, thereby reducing potential fire severity more than methods which left slash and/or masticated material within the stands. The various treatments created different conditions, and therefore the treatment intervals needed to maintain desired fire resilience would probably differ as well, being shorter for fire-only than for mechanical-only or mechanical-plus-fire treatments. Decisions about which treatments to prescribe, where, and when, will generally consider not only the financial costs and entry intervals, but other societal benefits and costs of the treatments and of wildfires as well.},

  abstract     = {In past decades, the European Mediterranean has undergone widespread land use transformations. These are largely driven by changes of socio-economic conditions, such as accession to the European Community, and had strong effects on the way the land is being used. Aiming at a systematic description of such change processes on a global level, the syndrome concept was proposed to describe archetypical, co-evolutionary patterns of human–nature interactions, and has been specifically linked to the desertification issue. In this study, we present an adaptation of the syndrome approach to the Iberian Peninsula. We suggest a data processing and interpretation framework to map the spatial extent of specific syndromes. The mapping approach is based on the time series analysis of satellite data. We have characterized vegetation dynamics using NDVI estimates from the coarse scale, hyper-temporal 1-km MEDOKADS archive, which is based on calibrated NOAA–AVHRR images. Results indicate that local patches of abrupt disturbance, mainly caused by fire, are contrasted by a widespread increase in vegetation, which is in large parts attributed to the abandonment of rural areas. Although this questions the dominance of classical desertification traits, i.e. decline of productivity after disturbance, it is concluded that the recent greening presents a different sort of environmental risk, as it may negatively impact on fire regimes and the hydrological cycle.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed fire is an important tool to manage some ecosystems, yet this message is a challenge to communicate to the public. The 2,282 wildfires that burned in Florida in 1998, causing \$800 million in lost timber and tourist revenues, underscore the impact of wildfire and the importance of using prescribed fire to ensure public safety. To understand public attitudes, knowledge, and behavioral intentions regarding wildland fire, we reviewed newspaper coverage of the 1998 wildfires and surveyed a random sample of 673 rural and suburban Florida residents living in counties experiencing high impacts or low impacts from the fires. The media and the survey respondents reported that the main benefit of prescribed burning was preventing more destructive fires. Media coverage and public opinion differed on the detrimental effects of prescribed burning. The media reported the spread of fire as a primary detriment, whereas the public reported harm to wild animals as the largest problem. Misconceptions about wildlife mortality suggest that simplistic messages of fire prevention campaigns need to be overcome. Proximity to the 1998 wildfires, based on county residence, did not change respondents' views of the benefits and constraints of prescribed burning, or their behavioral intentions toward reducing fire risks in their homes and landscapes. However, experience with prescribed burning and several sociodemographic factors were correlated with positive attitudes and increased knowledge levels.},

Communities who have developed CWPPs have done so using many different processes, resulting in plans with varied form and content. We analysed data from 13 case-study communities to illustrate how the characteristics of HFRA have encouraged communities to develop CWPPs that reflect their local social and ecological contexts. A framework for analysing policy implementation suggests that some elements of HFRA could have made CWPP development and implementation problematic, but these potential shortcomings in the statute have provided communities the freedom to develop CWPPs that are relevant to their conditions and allowed for the development of capacities that communities are using to move forward in several areas.},

These data include detailed information of respondents' views towards wildfire management and willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for prescribed burning. Results indicate that Colorado residents living near public lands are aware that fire is a natural process in their area and are in favor of using prescribed burning for fire risk reduction. They also are willing-to-pay an annual tax for prescribed fire undertaken on the public lands near their homes. Respondents' support for adopting a fire risk mitigation policy based on prescribed fire depended on perceived fire frequency intervals. The substantial WTP values for prescribed burning indicate that the public living in the wildland urban interface could potentially pay an annual tax, so the burden of wildfire management need no longer predominantly lie in the hands of the general taxpayers.},

  abstract     = {Abstract: Although numerous principles have been identified as being important for successfully integrating social and ecological factors in collaborative management, few authors have illustrated how these principles are used and why they are effective. On the basis of a review of the ecosystem management and collaboration literature, we identified eight factors important for integrative, collaborative ecosystem management—integrated and balanced goals, inclusive public involvement, stakeholder influence, consensus group approach, collaborative stewardship, monitoring and adaptive management, multidisciplinary data, and economic incentives.We examined four cases of successful ecosystem management to illustrate how the factors were incorporated and discuss the role they played in each case's success. The cases illustrate that balancing social and ecosystem sustainability goals is possible. Collaborative efforts resulted in part from factors aimed at making plans economically feasible and from meaningful stakeholder participation in ongoing management. It also required participation in monitoring programs to ensure stakeholder interests were protected and management efforts were focused on agreed-upon goals. Data collection efforts were not all-inclusive and systematic; rather, they addressed the ecological, economic, and social aspects of key issues as they emerged over time. Economic considerations appear to be broader than simply providing economic incentives; stakeholders seem willing to trade some economic value for recreational or environmental benefits. The cases demonstrate that it is not idealistic to believe integrative, collaborative ecosystem management is possible in field applications.},

It assesses the social and environmental fit of both local knowledge and scientific forestry and considers their abilities to contribute to sustainable forest management. Both bodies of knowledge are limited in their ability to inform the social practice of environmental management. The local forest knowledge system is particularly hampered by a limited ability to monitor the forest's response to woodcutting, while scientific forestry lacks the institutional flexibility to ensure the just and effective implementation of restrictions and prescriptions. This article recommends cross-learning between scientific resource managers and woodcutters, participatory environmental monitoring to assess the results of different cutting techniques, and explicit management experiments to facilitate institutional learning at the community level. This kind of adaptive management approach permits the flexible integration of local knowledge, scientific forestry, and appropriate institutional parameters to modulate human needs and goals with the discordant harmonies of inhabited and heavily used forests in a constant state of flux under processes of succession, disturbance, and spatial variation. Several barriers to this kind of institutional innovation exist, but outside intervention has the potential to change the dynamics of institutional evolution.},

  abstract     = {Growing recognition that periodic fire is critical for maintaining the health of many rangeland ecosystems and concerns over more frequent catastrophic wildfires have focused attention on prescribed fire as an ecosystem restoration and fuel management tool. In states such as Texas, where most land is privately owned, the level of success of outreach activities aimed at expanding the adoption of specific management practices is influenced by the extent to which landowners’ perceptions, interests, and concerns regarding such practices are addressed. This is particularly important for prescribed fire, which has been perceived by many landowners to be a dangerous or wasteful practice. Here we report the results of a mail survey of 185 members of the Edwards Plateau Prescribed Burn Association (EPPBA) and a random sample of 600 nonmember rural landowners in four counties in the Edwards Plateau and two counties in the Rolling Plains ecoregions of Texas. The overall response rate was 46.6\%. Primary reasons respondents did not apply fire on their land were insufficient resources, legal concerns, and lack of assistance with burn plan development. EPPBA members had more positive attitudes than nonmembers about the ecological role of fire and the use of prescribed fire. Our study suggests that adoption of prescribed burning as an integral part of land management plans by private landowners could be expanded by forming new prescribed burning associations. The EPPBA model for such associations provides learning opportunities that are consistent with adult learning and innovation adoption principles. It facilitates fire safety training, reduces concerns over legal liability associated with fire ignition, and enhances access to shared fire management equipment and labor on burn days. The two-tiered structure of the EPPBA with some form of state-level representation appears to be an efficient organizational structure for these associations.
Resumen
El reconocimiento cada vez mayor que el fuego periódico es crítico para mantener la salud de muchos ecosistemas de pastizales y las preocupaciones sobre los fuegos silvestres catastróficos mas frecuentes ha enfocado la atención en los fuegos prescritos como una herramienta en la restauración de un ecosistema y el manejo de combustible. En estados, tales como Texas, donde la mayoría de la tierra es propiedad privada, el nivel de éxito de las actividades de sobrepasar los objetivos en ampliar la adopción de específicas prácticas de manejo esta influenciado por el grado de las percepciones, los intereses, y las preocupaciones de los propietarios con respecto a las direcciones de dichas practicas. Esto es importante particularmente para el fuego prescrito, el cual ha sido percibido por muchos propietarios de tierras como una práctica peligrosa o costosa. Aquí nosotros mostramos los resultados de una encuesta por correo de 185 miembros de la Asociación de Quema Prescrita del Edwards Plateau (EPPBA) y una muestra al aleatoria de 600 propietarios tierras rurales no miembros en cuatro condados en el Edwards Plateau y dos condados de los Rolling Plains de Texas. La tasa de la respuesta total fue de 46.6\%. Las razones de los encuestados de no aplicar fuegos en sus tierras fueron recursos insuficientes, preocupaciones legales y la falta de asistencia con el desarrollo del plan de quema. Los miembros de la EPPBA tuvieron aptitudes más positivas que los no miembros sobre el rol ecológico del fuego y el uso del fuego prescrito. Nuestro estudio sugiere que la adopción de la quema prescrita como una parte integral de los planes de manejo de tierras de propietarios privados pudiera ampliarse mediante la creación de nuevas asociaciones de quema prescritas. El modelo de la EPPBA para tales asociaciones les brinda oportunidades de conocimiento que sean consistente con el conocimiento adulto y la innovación de los principios de adopción. Esto facilita el entrenamiento de seguridad contra incendio, reduce las preocupaciones sobre la responsabilidad legal asociada con la ignición del fuego, y facilita el acceso a compartir el equipo de manejo de incendio y la labor en los días de quemas. La estructura de dos niveles de la EPPBA con alguna forma de representación legal estatal parece ser una estructura organizacional eficiente para estas asociaciones.},

  abstract     = {Suppression of fire in the Southern Plains has led to proliferation of woody plants and fuel load accumulation that spurs wildfires. These effects have led to calls for widespread application of prescribed fire to reduce fuel loads, but there is substantial landowner resistance to the use of this land management tool. Here we explore factors that affect perceptions of landowners in the Southern Plains about prescribed fire liability and their willingness to apply this land management tool. This region was selected for the study because of the preponderance of private landholdings and widespread woody plant encroachment. The study used a mail survey of 1 853 landowners in 16 counties in Texas and Oklahoma, resulting in a data set from 680 respondents (37\% useable response rate). Logistic regression models were developed to test three hypotheses relating to the likelihood that a landowner will apply prescribed fire. The study corroborated that landowners who perceived higher levels of fire-related legal liability were less likely to apply prescribed fire on their land or assist with its application on other properties. In addition, burn bans were found to inhibit landowner willingness to apply fire during periods that result in higher woody plant mortality. Oklahoma respondents, landowners who believed prescribed fire to be an affordable woody plant management tool, and members of prescribed burning associations (PBAs) were more likely to use prescribed fire. These results have important implications for policies aimed at overcoming resistance to the use of prescribed fire to curb woody plant encroachment and reduce fuel load accumulation. Specifically, language in state statutes pertaining to prescribed fire should be modified to reduce landowner concerns over legal liability; PBAs should be established more widely; and public cost-sharing funds for woody plant management should prioritize prescribed fire.},

We used the amount spent as an estimate of fire magnitude. Current fire regime was estimated for the same area from the local environment agency data bank, which includes date, location and burned area. The mean number of recorded fires per year, which mostly occurred in summer, is not significantly different between the two periods. Time-since-fire distributions of both periods fitted the negative exponential model, and they were not significantly different. The probability of fire occurring within 1-year interval was 0.44 for the 1379–1466 period and 0.46 for the 1966–1996 period. In both cases, small fires were more abundant, although there are some differences in the medieval series, 13\% of all documented fires accounted for 47\% of the suppression effort, whereas in the 20th century series, one single fire accounted for 88\% of the area burned. Analysis of extreme fire also indicates that in the medieval series the largest fire per year needed one or less days of suppression effort in 58\% of the years, whereas in the current period, fires were smaller than 1ha in 78\% of the years. We found that fire suppression in the Middle Ages was associated with forest exploitation. Although we cannot compare the two data sets accurately, there is not evidence of differences in fire frequency between the medieval and the current periods. Differences in fire magnitude distributions of both series of records may be explained by the different purposes and technical resources involved in the fire suppression practices.},

These records exist in the form of maps prepared at local forest divisional (later district) offices from first-hand knowledge of the extent of prescribed burning activities and wildfires. Original maps have subsequently been incorporated into a Geographic Information System providing a unique insight into regimes of fire frequency and seasonality at a landscape scale over more than half a century. In this paper we examine ways in which fire history information can provide a context for contemporary management decisions about the use of fire for fuel reduction, and the effects of fire on forest ecosystems. More detailed records of the patchiness of burn patterns within prescribed burns and wildfires would assist in understanding the effects of fire at a landscape scale.},

This has prompted new calls for land management and policy reforms as current land and fire management approaches have been unable to effectively respond to the rapid changes in climate and development patterns that strongly control fire behaviour and continue to exacerbate the risks and hazards to human communities. Promoting social–ecological resilience in rapidly changing, fire-susceptible landscapes requires adoption of multiple perspectives of resilience, extending beyond ‘basic resilience’ (or bouncing back to a similar state) to include ‘adaptive resilience’ and ‘transformative resilience’, which require substantial and explicit changes to social–ecological systems. Clarifying these different perspectives and identifying where they will be most effective helps prioritize efforts to better coexist with wildfire in an increasingly flammable world.},

Public concern about the potential health and other impacts of smoke can cause apprehension among managers who are considering prescribed burns, some to the point that they choose not to burn. Yet, very little is known about public acceptance of smoke. Using results from public surveys in four states, this paper explores the factors that influence public acceptance of smoke from six types of fire (wildfire, prescribed fire, agricultural burns, managed fire, pile burns and burns on private lands) as well as aggregate acceptance across all fire types. Overall, the public is generally accepting of smoke, particularly for fire types that are either viewed as uncontrollable (wildfire) or providing benefits to broader society rather than individuals. However, a sizable minority does not accept smoke. Factors that influence acceptance of smoke vary by fire type, but several coincided for multiple types of fire, including both health and non-health related risk, confidence in managing agencies, beliefs about benefits of prescribed fire use and rural living, among others. Prior experience with negative health impacts from smoke only influenced acceptance for agricultural burns.},

Less work has attempted to document critical differences in that local social context across large samples. The research presented here explores a quantitative operationalization of an established framework for characterizing the social diversity of communities at risk from wildfire. We conducted structured interviews with key informants across nine U.S. states. Factor analysis, regression and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to characterize social context across communities and relate it to key informant evaluations of progress toward fire adaptation. Our results advance methods to systematically document how social context influences local wildfire adaptation by: (1) examining a preliminary set of quantitative key-informant measures for gauging social context across a range of WUI communities; (2) identifying related elements of social context that may collectively influence wildfire adaptations; (3) providing preliminary statistical evidence that highly related elements of local social context are correlated with expert assessment of local populations’ adaptations to wildfire; and (4) identifying differences in social context characteristics across a sample of western USA WUI communities. However, it also is important to recognize that the measures tested here serve as indicators of deeper conceptual understandings informed by in-depth case studies. Efforts to use these measures should be augmented with additional qualitative work and build from those deeper understandings by considering the complexity of local dynamics surrounding wildfire management.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the linkages between social and ecological systems is key to developing sustainable natural resource management (NRM) institutions. Frequently, however, insufficient attention is paid to the historical development of NRM institutions. Instead, discussion largely focuses on models of economic efficiency at the expense of the cultural, historical, and ecological contexts within which institutions develop. Here we use the research program of historical ecology to explore the development, maintenance, and change of two contemporary fire management institutions in northern Australia and Colorado, USA, to demonstrate how social institutions and ecological systems change and resist change over time and how institutions interact across scales to negotiate contrasting goals and motivations. We argue that these NRM institutions are not strictly speaking evolutionary or adaptive, and that historical context is critical when evaluating how and why particular institutions and institutional relationships develop. As with ecosystems, the present characteristics of the NRM institutions are dependent on what has happened before and their efficacy can only be evaluated retrospectively. Therefore, an understanding of history is essential to questions of the desirability and feasibility of institutional change where such shifts are required from an ecological, social, or economic perspective. We further propose that institutional conflict arises from the differing goals and motives of resource management institutions at different scales. Our cases reveal that larger-scale institutions can be successful at achieving narrowly defined goals but often fall short of achieving socially desirable sustainable outcomes. Our findings support the use of narratives of community history, place, and being in considering the resilience and sustainability of social-ecological systems. We offer that historical ecology is complementary with institutional and economic approaches to the analysis of NRM institutions, and possesses a particular strength in linking ecology to the values and norms of small social groups.},

  abstract     = {Kakadu National Park in northern Australia was one of the first jointly managed parks in the world, and offers an important case study of how public institutions and indigenous communities interact in the management of landscapes. In the 1990s, an extensive fire management program was instituted in Kakadu. The aim of this program was to shift the timing of fires from the late dry season to the early dry season, a pattern that on its surface more closely reflects precontact Aboriginal fire patterns. Despite broad success in this fire regime shift, Kakadu has come under particularly intense criticism from local Aboriginal communities, as well as the conservation sector and the wider public, for failures in fire management. These perceived failures are, however, assumed to be a feature of Kakadu specifically, rather than early season burning generally. Consequently, the model of extensive fire management in the early dry season continues to be a key goal for Aboriginal-owned lands across northern Australia, with early-burning projects that derive funding tied to reduced net carbon emissions now emerging as the most promising potential for reinstating indigenous fire management in northern Australia. We argue, however, that these new emissions-reducing programs run the risk of following the same fraught path of dissatisfaction and disassociation as Kakadu, because it is inherent in the nature of institutionalized management programs to replace the complexity and contingency of indigenous fire management with standardized goals. In so doing, such programs treat indigenous people as workers executing plans developed by others rather than as genuine partners in the design and implementation of management programs.},

  abstract     = {There is a debate on which factor, fuel accumulation or meteorological variability, is the fundamental control of the occurrence of large fires in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Its resolution has important management implications, because if the fuel hypothesis proves to be right, then fire-exclusion would enhance the occurrence of large wildfires, and prescribed-fires would be a useful tool to fight them. On the other hand, if large fires were just a direct consequence of some extreme weather situations, neither fire-exclusion nor prescribed fire would have any influence on the size of wildfires. Here we present a simple model of vegetation dynamics and fire spread over homogeneous areas intended to treat quantitatively this issue. In particular, we wanted to address the following questions: (1) What is the effect that different fire fighting capacities have on the total area burnt and, especially, on large fires? (2) What is the effect that different levels of prescribed fire have on the area burnt in wildfires and, especially, in large fires? The model incorporates meteorological variability, different rates of fuel accumulation, number of ignitions per year, fire-fighting capacity, and prescribed burning. The model was calibrated with fire regime data (mean fire size, annual area burnt, and fire size distribution) of Tarragona (NE Spain) and Coimbra (Central Portugal), and it accurately reproduced both data sets, while allowing for multiple behavioural models and prediction uncertainties within the GLUE methodology. Results showed that for a given region, with its particular characteristics of climate, number of ignitions, and vegetation flammability, there was a fairly constant annual area burnt for different fire-fighting capacities. However, higher fire-fighting capacities resulted in a slightly higher proportion of large fires. There was also a quite constant annual area burnt (prescribed and wild fires together) for different prescribed fire intensities in each region. However, the total amount and proportion of large fires decreased as the prescribed burning intensity increased. So, according to the model, it seems that the total area burnt will be more or less the same despite any effort to reduce it by extinguishing fires or by using prescribed burning. Nevertheless, the effect of the fire exclusion policy slightly enhances the dominance of large fires, whereas the use of prescribed fires greatly reduces the importance of large fires.},

  abstract     = {Fire exclusion policies have affected stand structure and wildfire hazard in north American ponderosa pine forests. Wildfires are becoming more severe in stands where trees are densely stocked with shade-tolerant understory trees. Although forest managers have been employing fuel treatment techniques to reduce wildfire hazard for decades, little scientific evidence documents the success of treatments in reducing fire severity. Our research quantitatively examined fire effects in treated and untreated stands in western United States national forests. Four ponderosa pine sites in Montana, Washington, California and Arizona were selected for study. Fuel treatments studied include: prescribed fire only, whole-tree thinning, and thinning followed by prescribed fire. On-the-ground fire effects were measured in adjacent treated and untreated forests. We developed post facto fire severity and stand structure measurement techniques to complete field data collection. We found that crown fire severity was mitigated in stands that had some type of fuel treatment compared to stands without any treatment. At all four of the sites, the fire severity and crown scorch were significantly lower at the treated sites. Results from this research indicate that fuel treatments, which remove small diameter trees, may be beneficial for reducing crown fire hazard in ponderosa pine sites.},

  abstract     = {The consequences of wildfires are felt in susceptible communities around the globe on an annual basis. Climate change predictions in places like the south-east of Australia and western United States suggest that wildfires may become more frequent and more intense with global climate change. Compounding this issue is progressive urban development at the peri-urban fringe (wildland–urban interface), where continued infrastructure development and demographic changes are likely to expose more people and property to this potentially disastrous natural hazard. Preparing well in advance of the wildfire season is seen as a fundamental behaviour that can both reduce community wildfire vulnerability and increase hazard resilience – it is an important element of adaptive capacity that allows people to coexist with the hazardous environment in which they live. We use household interviews and surveys to build and test a substantive model that illustrates how social cohesion influences the decision to prepare for wildfire. We demonstrate that social cohesion, particularly community characteristics like ‘sense of community’ and ‘collective problem solving’, are community-based resources that support both the adoption of mechanical preparations, and the development of cognitive abilities and capacities that reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to wildfire. We use the results of this work to highlight opportunities to transfer techniques and approaches from natural hazards research to climate change adaptation research to explore how the impacts attributed to the social components of social–ecological systems can be mitigated more effectively.},

  abstract     = {Wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to further warming. As a consequence, the wildland–urban interface is projected to experience substantially higher risk of climate-driven fires in the coming decades. Although many plants, animals, and ecosystem services benefit from fire, it is unknown how ecosystems will respond to increased burning and warming. Policy and management have focused primarily on specified resilience approaches aimed at resistance to wildfire and restoration of areas burned by wildfire through fire suppression and fuels management. These strategies are inadequate to address a new era of western wildfires. In contrast, policies that promote adaptive resilience to wildfire, by which people and ecosystems adjust and reorganize in response to changing fire regimes to reduce future vulnerability, are needed. Key aspects of an adaptive resilience approach are (i) recognizing that fuels reduction cannot alter regional wildfire trends; (ii) targeting fuels reduction to increase adaptation by some ecosystems and residential communities to more frequent fire; (iii) actively managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of severities; and (iv) incentivizing and planning residential development to withstand inevitable wildfire. These strategies represent a shift in policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable defense of the wildland–urban interface to developing fire-adapted communities. We propose an approach that accepts wildfire as an inevitable catalyst of change and that promotes adaptive responses by ecosystems and residential communities to more warming and wildfire.},

Developing assessments and tools to help provide this information is a high priority for federal land management agencies such as the US Forest Service (USFS) that have limited resources to invest in hazardous fuel reduction and other mitigation activities. In this manuscript we investigate the degree to which fuel management practices on USFS land can reduce wildfire exposure to human communities. We leverage wildfire simulation with spatial risk analysis techniques and examine a range of hypothetical fuel treatment scenarios on a landscape encompassing the Sierra National Forest in California, USA. Results suggest that treating USFS land does little to reduce overall wildland urban interface (WUI) exposure across the landscape. A treatment scenario that focused on treating defensible space near homes was by far the most efficient at reducing WUI exposure, including exposure transmitted from USFS lands. Findings highlight potential tradeoffs and raise questions as to what other land management objectives fuel treatments on federal lands might be able to more cost-effectively achieve relative to WUI protection. Site-specific risk-based analyses can help elucidate these tradeoffs and opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Wildfires increased dramatically in frequency and extent in the European Mediterranean region from the 1960s, aided by a general warming and drying trend, but driven primarily by socio-economic changes, including rural depopulation, land abandonment and afforestation with flammable species. Published research into post-wildfire hydrology and soil erosion, beginning during the 1980s in Spain, has been followed by studies in other European Mediterranean countries together with Israel and has now attained a sufficiently large critical mass to warrant a major review. Although variations in climate, vegetation, soil, topography and fire severity cause differences in Mediterranean post-wildfire erosion, the long history of human landscape impact up to the present day is responsible for some its distinctive characteristics. This paper highlights these characteristics in reviewing wildfire impacts on hydrology, soil properties and soil erosion by water. The ‘mosaic’ nature of many Mediterranean landscapes (e.g. an intricate land-use pattern, abandoned terraces and tracks interrupting slopes) may explain sometimes conflicting post-fire hydrological and erosional responses at different sites and spatial scales. First-year post-wildfire soil losses at point- (average, 45–56tha−1) and plot-scales (many {$<$}1tha−1 and the majority {$<$}10tha−1 in the first year) are similar to or even lower than those reported for fire-affected land elsewhere or other disturbed (e.g. cultivated) and natural poorly-vegetated (e.g. badlands, rangeland) land in the Mediterranean. The few published losses at larger-scales (hillslope and catchment) are variable. Thin soil and high stone content can explain supply-limited erosion preceding significant protection by recovering vegetation. Peak erosion can sometimes be delayed for years, largely through slow vegetation recovery and temporal variability of erosive storms. Preferential removal of organic matter and nutrients in the commonly thin, degraded soils is arguably just as if not more important than the total soil loss. Aspect is important, with more erosion reported for south- than north-facing slopes, which is attributed to greater fire frequency, slower vegetation recovery on the former and with soil characteristics more prone to erosion (e.g. lower aggregate stability). Post-fire wind erosion is a potentially important but largely neglected process. Gauging the degradational significance of wildfires has relied on comparison with unburnt land, but the focus for comparison should be switched to other agents of soil disturbance and/or currently poorly understood soil renewal rates. Human impact on land use and vegetation may alter expected effects (increased fire activity and post-wildfire erosion) arising from future climatic change. Different future wildfire mitigation responses and likely erosional consequences are outlined. Research gaps are identified, and more research effort is suggested to: (1) improve assessment of post-wildfire erosion impact on soil fertility, through further quantification of soil nutrient depletion resulting from single and multiple fire cycles, and on soil longevity; (2) investigate prescribed fire impacts on carbon release, air pollution and nutrient losses as well as on soil loss; (3) isolate hillslope- and catchment-scale impacts of soil water repellency under Mediterranean post-wildfire conditions; (4) test and refine application of cosmogenic radionuclides to post-wildfire hillslope-scale soil redistribution at different temporal scales; (5) use better temporal resolution of sedimentary sequences to understand palaeofire-erosion–sedimentation links; (6) quantify post-wildfire wind erosion; (7) improve the integration of wildfire into an overall assessment of the processes and impacts of land degradation in the Mediterranean; and (8) raise public awareness of wildfire impact on soil degradation.},

The biophysical changes in fuels, wildfire behavior, and climate have created a new set of conditions for which our wildfire governance system is poorly suited to address. To address these challenges, a reorientation of goals is needed to focus on creating an anticipatory wildfire governance system focused on social and ecological resilience. Key characteristics of this system could include the following: (1) not taking historical patterns as givens; (2) identifying future social and ecological thresholds of concern; (3) embracing diversity/heterogeneity as principles in ecological and social responses; and (4) incorporating learning among different scales of actors to create a scaffolded learning system.},

  abstract     = {Forest-fire policy of U.S. federal agencies has evolved from the use of small patrols in newly created National Parks to diverse policy initiatives and institutional arrangements that affect millions of hectares of forests. Even with large expenditures and substantial infrastructure dedicated to fire suppression, the annual area burned by wildfire has increased over the last decade. Given the current and future challenges of fire management, and based on analytical research and review of existing policies and their implications, we believe several changes and re-emphases in existing policy are warranted. Most importantly, the actual goal of fuels-management projects should be the reduction of potential fire behavior and effects, not the simple reduction of fuels. To improve safety and economic efficiency, fire-suppression policies should recognize differences in the characteristics of wildfires, and strategies should be tailored to better respond to the unique demands of each fire. Where forest fires are burning large areas, as in the western United States, reducing the trend of increased amounts of burned area may require a diversity of treatments, including prescribed burning, mechanical fuels treatment, and increased use of the Wildland Fire Use Policy. Assessment of how fire is affecting forests would be enhanced if land-management agencies reported the area burned by low-, mixed-, and high-severity fire and what proportion is outside the desired trend or range of conditions for each forest type. Congress should provide an improved budgetary process for fire and fuels management, with a larger annual federal fire-suppression budget. Additionally, reducing annual area burned will require long-term coordinated efforts by federal and state governments, with robust partnerships between land-management agencies and the public in collaborative planning and stewardship. Research and adaptive management are essential in allowing fire-hazard-reduction projects to move forward where proposed projects are met with uncertainty and mistrust. While legislative reform may be desirable, a strategy that is not entirely dependent on new legislation is needed. Building on existing programs that are consistent with a science-based strategy will enable land-management agencies to better utilize information in pursuit of the overall objective of reducing uncharacteristically severe wildfires.},

Policy-makers are challenged not to categorize all fires as destructive to ecosystems simply because they have long flame lengths and kill most of the trees within the fire boundary. Ecological context matters: In some ecosystems, high-severity regimes are appropriate, but climate change may modify these fire regimes and ecosystems as well. Some undesirable impacts may be avoided or reduced through global strategies, as well as distinct strategies based on a forest's historical fire regime.

A multivariate ordered probit model was estimated to examine factors that have influenced the retention of certain liability rules across states. Demand for prescribed fires from industrial and nonindustrial private forest landowners turned out to be the key driving force behind these statutory changes related to prescribed fires.},

Ecosystem management emphasizes place- or region-based objectives, with scopes and approaches defined appropriately for each given situation.

  abstract     = {In the western United States and elsewhere, the need to change society’s relationship with wildfire is well-recognized. Suppressing fewer fires in fire-prone systems is promoted to escape existing feedback loops that lead to ever worsening conditions and increasing risks to responders and communities. Our primary focus is how to catalyze changes in fire manager behavior such that responses are safer, more effective, and capitalize on opportunities for expanded use of fire. We daylight deep-seated, systemic drivers of behavior, and in so doing, challenge ingrained ways of thinking and acting that may be inconsistent with current intentions around wildland fire management. We pose the questions of whether all fires are emergencies that require rapid deployment and concentration of suppression resources, whether rhetoric and actions align with policy and guidance, and whether we can unambiguously define and measure what a safe and effective response looks like. Using the Forest Service of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a relevant test case for systemic investigation, we argue that fundamental changes in how the fire management community thinks about, learns from, plans for, and responds to wildland fires may be necessary. Our intention is to initiate a broader dialog around the current and future state of wildland fire management.},

The result has been widespread juniper encroachment and the degradation of the multiple valuable ecosystem services provided by grasslands. Here, we review the social–ecological causes and consequences of the transformation of grasslands to juniper woodlands and synthesize the recent emergence of prescribed burn cooperatives, an extensive societal movement by private citizens to restore fire to the Great Plains biome. We discuss how burn cooperatives have helped citizens overcome dominant social constraints that limit the application of prescribed fire to improve management of encroaching woody plants in grasslands. These constraints include the generally held assumptions and political impositions that all fires should be eliminated when wildfire danger increases.},

  abstract     = {Effective fire suppression and land use practices over the last century have altered forest structure and increased fuel loads in many forests in the United States, increasing the occurrence of catastrophic wildland fires. The most effective methods to change potential fire behavior are to reduce surface fuels, increase the canopy base height and reduce canopy bulk density. This multi-tiered approach breaks up the continuity of surface, ladder and crown fuels. Effectiveness of fuel treatments is often shown indirectly through fire behavior modeling or directly through monitoring wildland fire effects such as tree mortality. The present study investigates how prescribed fire affected fuel loads, forest structure, potential fire behavior, and modeled tree mortality at 90th and 97.5th percentile fire weather conditions on eight National Forests in California. Prescription burning did not significantly change forest structure at most sites. Total fuel loads (litter, duff, 1, 10, 100, and 1000-h) were reduced by 23 to 78\% across the sites. The reduction in fuel loads altered potential fire behavior by reducing fireline intensity and increasing torching index and crowning index at most sites. Predicted tree mortality decreased after treatment as an effect of reduced potential fire behavior and fuel loads. To use limited fuel hazard reduction resources efficiently, more effort could be placed on the evaluation of existing fire hazards because several stands in the present study had little potential for adverse fire effects before prescribed fire was applied.},

This was done by exploring the associations between these changes and a selection of both biophysical and socio-economic variables in a study area of 44 square km. For each conversion of arable land into one of the three other land use types the descriptive power of the various independent variables were evaluated using logistic regression. By comparing different statistical models (one containing only the biophysical attributes, another model containing only the socio-economic variables and finally a model containing both types of variables) the relative importance of socio-economic and biophysical variables was evaluated. The results show that both the biophysical and socio-economic variables were significantly associated with the occurrences of the land use changes. However, the models containing only the socio-economic variables were stronger related to occurrences of afforestation and regeneration of the montado, whereas the biophysical variables were more related to land abandonment. The landowner type was a significant descriptive variable across all land use change models. The results suggest that local socio-economic factors are significant in explaining the pattern of the conversion of arable land in the study area and for this reason the variety of landowners’ response to the physical conditions deserves more attention in land use change modelling.},

  abstract     = {Changing climate and fuel accumulation are increasing wildfire risks across the western United States. This has led to calls for fire management reform, including the systematic use of prescribed fire. Although use of prescribed fire by private landowners in the southern Great Plains has increased during the past 30 yr, studies have determined that liability concerns are a major reason why many landowners do not use or promote the use of prescribed fire. Generally, perceptions of prescribed fire−related liability are based on concerns over legal repercussions for escaped fire. This paper reviews the history and current legal liability standards used in the United States for prescribed fire, it examines how perceived and acceptable risk decisions about engagement in prescribed burning and other activities differ, and it presents unanticipated outcomes in two cases of prescribed fire insurance aimed at promoting the use of prescribed fire. We demonstrate that the empirical risk of liability from escaped fires is minimal ({$<$}1\%) and that other underlying factors may be leading to landowners’ exaggerated concerns of risk of liability when applying prescribed fire. We conclude that providing liability insurance may not be the most effective approach for increasing the use of prescribed fire by private landowners. Clearly differentiating the risks of applying prescribed fire from those of catastrophic wildfire damages, changing state statutes to reduce legal liability for escaped fire, and expanding landowner membership in prescribed burn associations may be more effective alternatives for attaining this goal. Fear of liability is a major deterrent to the use of prescribed fire; however, an evaluation of the risks from escaped fire does not support perceptions that using prescribed fire as a land management tool is risky. Prescribed burning associations and agencies that support land management improvement have an important role to play in spreading this message.},

  abstract     = {The extent to which use of fire by Aboriginal peoples shaped the landscapes and biota of Australia is a contentious issue. Equally contentious is the proposition that attempts should be made to support and re-establish customary practice. Some dismiss Aboriginal practice as little more than culturally endorsed pyromania, and consequences for land, vegetation and wildlife management as incidental and unintended outcomes. We argue that this view of Aboriginal practice is at odds with available evidence regarding motivations for use of fire, and detailed and sophisticated descriptions of the consequences of poor fire management for the maintenance of important resources. We suggest that misunderstanding arises, at least in part, from the contrasting views that (i) objectives of Aboriginal land managers and the values they seek to extract and maintain in savanna landscapes are or should be similar to those of non-Indigenous land managers; or (ii) the notion that their goals are inherently and entirely incompatible with those of non-indigenous interests. We illustrate our argument with examples that include assessments of ecological consequences of 'prescribed' Aboriginal practice, statements from Aboriginal people regarding their objectives in applying those prescriptions, and the level of active organisation required for their effective implementation. Finally, we propose mechanisms for wider application of Aboriginal prescriptions in tropical landscapes to meet a range of land management objectives.},

A variety of historical, political, social, environmental and financial reasons have resulted in a wide spectrum of forest fire management organization schemes. As fire problems, in the form of very bad fire seasons, are becoming all the time more pronounced and visible, there is often pressure for changes in the fire management structure in the affected countries, in one direction or another. Sometimes the demand for such changes is extreme, especially after major wildfire disasters. Obviously, this can lead to serious mistakes. In this paper the change in the organization of forest fire management that took place in 1998 in Greece is described in brief. The example is used to demonstrate the pitfalls and the problems and to document the need for objective criteria on how fire management should be organized in a country, given its own unique conditions.},

  abstract     = {Like all social institutions, governance systems that address human–environment relations – commonly know as environmental or resource regimes – are dynamic. Although analysts have examined institutional change from a variety of perspectives, a particularly puzzling feature of institutional dynamics arises from the fact that some regimes linger on relatively unchanged even after they have become ineffective, while others experience state changes or even collapse in the wake of seemingly modest trigger events. This article employs the framework developed to study resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation in socio-ecological systems (the SES framework) in an effort to illuminate the conditions leading to state changes in environmental and resource regimes. Following a discussion of several conceptual issues, it examines institutional stresses, stress management mechanisms, and the changes that occur when interactive and cumulative stresses overwhelm these mechanisms. An important conclusion concerns the desirability of thinking systematically about institutional reform in a timely manner, in order to be prepared for brief windows of opportunity to make planned changes in environmental regimes when state changes occur.},

  abstract = {Burning landscapes under controlled conditions to reduce the risk of wildfires is a controversial land management practice. The health risks of smoke generated from controlled burning relative to wildfire remain uncertain. Recent work in the Australian monsoon tropics provided a unique opportunity to study the health effects of smoke pollution at and well below national air quality standards. It found that for each increase in the atmospheric mass of particles 10 μg or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) per cubic meter of air per 24-hour period, there was a 26\% increase in daily asthma presentations to the emergency department of the Royal Darwin Hospital, with an apparent threshold at 40 μg/m3 PM10 (lower than the Australian PM10 air quality standard of 50 μg/m3). This finding was unaffected by adjusting for weekly rates of influenza, weekday vs. weekends, and school holiday periods. Although further research is being undertaken to substantiate these findings, the upshot of the study suggests that for airsheds containing large human populations, fire managers should strive to keep smoke pollution less than 40 μg/m3 PM10.},

  abstract     = {In Pacific Northwest prairies and oak woodlands, cessation of anthropogenic burning in the mid-1800s resulted in large-scale degradation and loss of habitat due to tree and shrub encroachment. Widespread invasive species, deep thatch accumulations, and extensive moss cover now limit the ability of native plants to germinate and thrive. These changes in habitat structure and function have contributed to the decline of several plant and animal species. Over the past decade, prescribed fire has been increasingly applied throughout the Willamette Valley-Puget Trough-Georgia Basin Ecoregion and used in conjunction with other techniques (herbicide, seeding native species) to restore native habitat with variable results. This variability likely is a result of differential fire intensity, dictated by fuels, weather and application technique, all of which can be controlled for by altering fire season, fire frequency, pre-fire treatments and fire extent. In order to burn at the spatial and temporal scales necessary for effective habitat restoration, however, prescribed burn programs must overcome several socio-political, programmatic and economic challenges. This requires a collaborative approach to prescribed fire training, implementation and research. Future research on fire season, fire frequency, species-specific responses to fire and effects of fire surrogates on ecosystem structure and functioning will help to refine prescribed fire management for maximum effectiveness in prairie and oak woodland restoration.},

  abstract     = {Fire is being prescribed and used increasingly to promote ecosystem restoration (e.g., oak woodlands and savannas) and to manage wildlife habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian regions, USA. However, questions persist as to how fire affects hardwood forest communities and associated wildlife, and how fire should be used to achieve management goals. We provide an up-to-date review of fire effects on various wildlife species and their habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians. Documented direct effects (i.e., mortality) on wildlife are rare. Indirect effects (i.e., changes in habitat quality) are influenced greatly by light availability, fire frequency, and fire intensity. Unless fire intensity is great enough to kill a portion of the overstory, burning in closed-canopy forests has provided little benefit for most wildlife species in the region because it doesn’t result in enough sunlight penetration to elicit understory response. Canopy reduction through silvicultural treatment has enabled managers to use fire more effectively. Fire intensity must be kept low in hardwoods to limit damage to many species of overstory trees. However, wounding or killing trees with fire benefits many wildlife species by allowing increased sunlight to stimulate understory response, snag and subsequent cavity creation, and additions of large coarse woody debris. In general, a fire-return interval of 2 yr to 7 yr benefits a wide variety of wildlife species by providing a diverse structure in the understory; increasing browse, forage, and soft mast; and creating snags and cavities. Historically, dormant-season fire was most prevalent in these regions, and it still is when most prescribed fire is implemented in hardwood systems as burn-days are relatively few in the growing season of May through August because of shading from leaf cover and high fuel moisture. Late growing-season burning increases the window for burning, and better control on woody composition is possible. Early growing-season fire may pose increased risk for some species, especially herpetofauna recently emerged from winter hibernacula (April) or forest songbirds that nest in the understory (May to June). However, negative population-level effects are unlikely unless the burned area is relatively large and early growing-season fire is used continually. We did not find evidence that fire is leading to population declines for any species, including Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species (e.g., Indiana bat [Myotis sodalis Mill. Allen] or northern long-eared bat [M. septentrionalis Trouess.]). Instead, data indicate that fire can enhance habitat for bats by increasing suitability of foraging and day-roost sites. Similarly, concern over burning and displacement of woodland salamanders (Plethodontidae), another taxa of heightened conservation concern, is alleviated when fire is prescribed along ecologically appropriate aspect and slope gradients and not forced into mesic, high site index environments where salamanders are most common. Because topography across the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians is diverse, we contend that applying fire on positions best suited for burning is an effective approach to increase regional landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity. Herein, we offer prescriptive concepts for burning for various wildlife species and guilds in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians.},

  abstract     = {Air quality impacts from wildfires have been dramatic in recent years, with millions of people exposed to elevated and sometimes hazardous fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations for extended periods. Fires emit particulate matter (PM) and gaseous compounds that can negatively impact human health and reduce visibility. While the overall trend in U.S. air quality has been improving for decades, largely due to implementation of the Clean Air Act, seasonal wildfires threaten to undo this in some regions of the United States. Our understanding of the health effects of smoke is growing with regard to respiratory and cardiovascular consequences and mortality. The costs of these health outcomes can exceed the billions already spent on wildfire suppression. In this critical review, we examine each of the processes that influence wildland fires and the effects of fires, including the natural role of wildland fire, forest management, ignitions, emissions, transport, chemistry, and human health impacts. We highlight key data gaps and examine the complexity and scope and scale of fire occurrence, estimated emissions, and resulting effects on regional air quality across the United States. The goal is to clarify which areas are well understood and which need more study. We conclude with a set of recommendations for future research. Implications In the recent decade the area of wildfires in the United States has increased dramatically and the resulting smoke has exposed millions of people to unhealthy air quality. In this critical review we examine the key factors and impacts from fires including natural role of wildland fire, forest management, ignitions, emissions, transport, chemistry and human health.},

Design and setting: An ecological study conducted in Darwin (Northern Territory, Australia) from 1 April – 31 October 2000, a period characterised by minimal rainfall and almost continuous bushfire activity in the proximate bushland. The exposure variable was the mean atmospheric concentration of particles of 10 microns or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) per cubic metre per 24-hour period. Outcome measure: The daily number of presentations for asthma to the Emergency Department of Royal Darwin Hospital. Results: There was a significant increase in asthma presentations with each 10-µg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration, even after adjusting for weekly rates of influenza and for weekend or weekday (adjusted rate ratio, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.09–1.34; P {$<$} 0.001). The strongest effect was seen on days when the PM10 was above 40 µg/m3 (adjusted rate ratio, 2.39; 95\% CI, 1.46–3.90), compared with days when PM10 levels were less than 10 µg/m3. Conclusion: Airborne particulates from bushfires should be considered as injurious to human health as those from other sources. Thus, the control of smoke pollution from bushfires in urban areas presents an additional challenge for managers of fireprone landscapes.},

Research has focussed on identifying these constraints, yet past efforts have focussed disproportionately on single agencies and geographic regions. We examined constraints on prescribed fire by surveying a wide variety of organisations (including six state and federal agencies and several tribes, non-governmental organisations and timber companies) in northern California, a fire-prone region of the western United States. Across the region, prescribed burning annually covered only 38\% of the area needed to fulfil land-management objectives, and 66\% of managers indicated dissatisfaction with levels of prescribed fire activity. The highest-ranked impediments were narrow burn window, regulations, lack of adequate personnel and environmental laws. Impediment ratings differed among entities, with legal and social impediments of greater concern in the private sector than in the public, and economic impediments of greater concern in the state and private sectors than in the federal. Comparisons with the south-eastern United States, where similar research has taken place, point to important regional constraints on prescribed fire activity. These findings suggest further need for research spanning geographic and ownership boundaries, as prescribed fire impediments can vary by context.},

We investigated the role of policy barriers and opportunities for prescribed fire application on US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands in the western United States. We conducted 54 semi-structured interviews with federal and state land managers and air quality regulators, and with several non-federal partners. We found that lack of adequate capacity and funding were the most commonly cited barriers to increasing application of prescribed fire. Interviewees also emphasised that owing to a lack of incentives and the prevalence of risk aversion at multiple agency levels, active prescribed fire programs depend on the leadership and commitment of individual decision-makers and fire managers. Successful approaches also rely on collaborative forums and positions that allow communication, problem-solving and resource sharing among federal and state partners, and that facilitate dialogue between air-quality and land managers. We did not find that air quality regulation was consistently cited as a major barrier, except in specific locations. Our findings highlight the importance of contextualised investigation into policy barriers and the role of collaborative and multilevel governance approaches for addressing complex land management challenges.},

  abstract     = {Management intervention in ecosystems with degraded environmental services requires innovative resource management strategies that go beyond conventional restoration and conservation practices. We established a unique study that experimentally targeted extreme fire conditions during drought in humid subtropical and semi-arid ecoregions. In the southern Great Plains of North America, conventional restoration and conservation practices have been either historically ineffective or economically cost-prohibitive at restoring grass-dominated ecosystems following conversion to resprouting shrublands. Our aim was to assess the potential for extreme fire during drought to force the system along an alternate ecological trajectory from its current progression towards closed-canopy resprouting shrubland, something that conventional fire prescriptions have been unable to accomplish. We first tested the potential for high-intensity fires exhibiting extreme behaviour to disrupt the progression from grassland to shrubland. In both ecoregions, significant levels of mortality were observed for mature woody resprouters. As a result, densities were either maintained or reduced 3 years following extreme fire treatments, whereas resprouter densities continued to increase in areas that were not burned. A second interventionist approach involving extreme fire and herbicide treatment combinations was not supported. Interactions between prescribed extreme fire and herbicide did not significantly reduce resprouter densities more than using herbicide alone at either site. Synthesis and applications. Extreme fires during drought resulted in exceptionally high levels of mortality across all sizes of woody resprouters and limited recruitment, resulting in 35–55\% lower densities of resprouters than in areas not burned. These findings counter prevailing scientific and management expectations, which are based largely on studies that impose tight controls over prescribed fire conditions and avoid extreme fire behaviour. Future interventions for controlling woody resprouters with fire may require rethinking the present ideology that extreme fire behaviour has no place in modern social–ecological landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Home and contents insurance is integral to household and community resilience against disasters. Yet many households are underinsured. While causes for underinsurance have been widely researched, changes to Australian building regulations in the last decade has established a new source of insurance miscalculations. Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) ratings can inflate rebuilding costs by 20\% or more, yet BAL ratings remain obfuscated to homeowners and are notoriously confusing to navigate. After the October 2013 bushfires in New South Wales, the Blue Mountains Local Recovery Steering Group found that ‘information on the BAL process, the guidelines, the expected costs, the consulting experts and a property’s bushfire-prone status is literally all over the place’. This paper aims to provide clarity on the subject, tracing the precise socio-technical means through which disaster risk is perceived and assessed. The paper conceptualises insurance and risk ratings as calculative devices that provide both a technical solution to reduce financial losses and a philosophical tool for risk rationalisation. It then builds on interviews conducted with residents in the Blue Mountains affected by the 2013 bushfires, to ascertain how such calculative devices practically affect communities at risk. The paper concludes by outlining potential solutions to a confusing and costly problem in Australia, highlighting critical public awareness issues surround BAL ratings, which have profound insurance and wellbeing implications for people rebuilding and recovering from bushfire.},

  abstract     = {We analyzed the impact of amenity and biodiversity protection as mandated in national forest plans on the implementation of hazardous fuel reduction treatments aimed at protecting the wildland urban interface (WUI) and restoring fire resilient forests. We used simulation modeling to delineate areas on national forests that can potentially transmit fires to adjacent WUI. We then intersected these areas with national forest planning maps to determine where mechanical treatments are allowed for restoration and fire protection, versus areas where they are prohibited. We found that a large proportion of the national forest lands (79\%) can spawn fires that burn adjacent WUIs. The bulk of the predicted WUI exposure originated from simulated fires ignited outside of conservation and preservation reserves and in dry forests, rather than moist mixed conifer forests. Thus the notion that fuel buildup in reserves on national forests contributes to wildfire risk in the urban interface was only partially supported by the data for the region studied. Most of the national forest lands that contribute wildfires to the WUI are not within the boundaries of community wildfire protection plans, which may undermine the effectiveness of these planning efforts. We used the spatial data themes developed in the study to map conflicts and opportunities for restoration and mitigation of WUI wildfire risk. The analysis disentangles the spatial complexity of managing landscapes for multiple socio-ecological objectives as part of ongoing restoration programs, collaborative planning, and national forest plan revisions on national forests in the US.},

  abstract     = {Wildland fire suppression practices in the western United States are being widely scrutinized by policymakers and scientists as costs escalate and large fires increasingly affect social and ecological values. One potential solution is to change current fire suppression tactics to intentionally increase the area burned under conditions when risks are acceptable to managers and fires can be used to achieve long-term restoration goals in fire adapted forests. We conducted experiments with the Envision landscape model to simulate increased levels of wildfire over a 50-year period on a 1.2 million ha landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon, USA. We hypothesized that at some level of burned area fuels would limit the growth of new fires, and fire effects on the composition and structure of forests would eventually reduce future fire intensity and severity. We found that doubling current rates of wildfire resulted in detectable feedbacks in area burned and fire intensity. Area burned in a given simulation year was reduced about 18\% per unit area burned in the prior five years averaged across all scenarios. The reduction in area burned was accompanied by substantially lower fire severity, and vegetation shifted to open forest and grass-shrub conditions at the expense of old growth habitat. Negative fire feedbacks were slightly moderated by longer-term positive feedbacks, in which the effect of prior area burned diminished during the simulation. We discuss trade-offs between managing fuels with wildfire versus prescribed fire and mechanical fuel treatments from a social and policy standpoint. The study provides a useful modeling framework to consider the potential value of fire feedbacks as part of overall land management strategies to build fire resilient landscapes and reduce wildfire risk to communities in the western U.S. The results are also relevant to prior climate-wildfire studies that did not consider fire feedbacks in projections of future wildfire activity.},

  abstract     = {Decentralization of governance is an emerging trend in many natural resource sectors in both developed and developing countries. Despite the normative agenda of community-based natural resource management for social and ecological outcomes, a shift to multilevel or polycentric theorizing is warranted. Polycentric governance recognizes the importance of cross-scale interactions, as well as the horizontal and vertical institutional linkages of authority, networks, and markets in which community institutions are embedded. Based on qualitative community forestry research in Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada, this article explores the themes of livelihood and local economy, collaborative forest planning and participation, and environmental governance. Bottom-up empirical evidence suggests that viewing community forestry through a polycentric governance network is necessary for theorizing complex cross-scale dynamics. Incentivizing policies that encourage the development of polycentric systems for natural resource governance is important for maintaining local benefits, while increasing adaptive capacity to deal with complex social–ecological challenges.},

This article argues that rather than trying to determine one encompassing definition of the concept, several different types of coproduction can be distinguished. Starting from the classical definitions of Elinor Ostrom and Roger Parks, the article draws on the literature on professionalism, volunteering, and public management to identify the distinctive nature of coproduction and identify basic dimensions on which a typology of coproduction can be constructed. Recognizing different types of coproduction more systematically is a critical step in making research on this phenomenon more comparable and more cumulative.},

  abstract     = {Ecosystem management is managing areas at various scales in such a way that ecological services and biological resources are conserved while appropriate human uses are sustained. Major ecological services include allocation of productivity (energy flow), maintenance of soil fertility (nutrient cycling), and operation of the hydrologic cycle. Biological resources encompass all natural variation found in genes, species, and communities along with the processes that maintain this variation. The appropriateness and sustainability of human uses are dictated by the constraints imposed by the biological and physical environment and by legal mandates for land use. There are seven critical steps in ecosystem management. These are: (1) delineate (define) the ecosystem to be managed; (2) define strategic management goals; (3) develop a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem; (4) obtain socioeconomic data; (5) link the socioeconomic and ecological data in an appropriate model; (6) implement experimental management actions; and (7) monitor management results to determine long-term success or failure. The significance of ecosystem management is that it focuses on ecological systems as a whole rather than on just some of their parts, includes public involvement in the goal-setting process, integrates conservation into economic activity, and represents a paradigm shift from `linear comprehensive' management to `cyclic-incremental' or `adaptive' management.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACT. Wildland fire management in the United States is caught in a rigidity trap, an inability to apply novelty and innovation in the midst of crisis. Despite wide recognition that public agencies should engage in ecological fire restoration, fire suppression still dominates planning and management, and restoration has failed to gain traction. The U.S. Fire Learning Network (FLN), a multiscalar collaborative endeavor established in 2002 by federal land management agencies and The Nature Conservancy, offers the potential to overcome barriers that inhibit restoration planning and management. By circulating people, planning products, and information among landscape- and regional-scale collaboratives, this network has facilitated the development and dissemination of innovative approaches to ecological fire restoration. Through experimentation and innovation generated in the network, the FLN has fostered change by influencing fire and land management plans as well as federal policy. We suggest that multiscalar collaborative planning networks such as the FLN can facilitate overcoming the rigidity traps that prevent resource management agencies from responding to complex cross-scalar problems.},

These fires are consistent with the characteristics of large, damaging, interface fires that threaten communities across much of the western United States.

We propose the principles of risk analysis to provide land management agencies, first responders, and affected communities who face the inevitability of wildfires the ability to reduce the potential for loss.

  abstract = {Over the last two decades wildfire activity, damage, and management cost within the US have increased substantially. These increases have been associated with a number of factors including climate change and fuel accumulation due to a century of active fire suppression. The increased fire activity has occurred during a time of significant ex-urban development of the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) along with increased demand on water resources originating on forested landscapes. These increased demands have put substantial pressure on federal agencies charged with wildfire management to continue and expand the century old policy of aggressive wildfire suppression. However, aggressive wildfire suppression is one of the major factors that drive the increased extent, intensity, and damage associated with the small number of large wildfires that are unable to be suppressed. In this paper we discuss the positive feedback loops that lead to demands for increasing suppression response while simultaneously increasing wildfire risk in the future. Despite a wealth of scientific research that demonstrates the limitations of the current management paradigm pressure to maintain the existing system are well entrenched and driven by the existing social systems that have evolved under our current management practice. Interestingly, US federal wildland fire policy provides considerable discretion for managers to pursue a range of management objectives; however, societal expectations and existing management incentive structures result in policy implementation that is straining the resilience of fire adapted ecosystems and the communities that reside in and adjacent to them.},

  abstract     = {Development of efficient forest wildfire policies requires an understanding of the underlying reasons behind forest fire occurrences. Globally, there is a close relationship between forest wildfires and human activities; most wildfires are human events due to negligence (e.g., agricultural burning escapes) and deliberate actions (e.g., vandalism, pyromania, revenge, land use change attempts). We model the risk of wildfire as a function of the spatial pattern of urban development and the abandonment/intensity of agricultural and forestry activities, while controlling for biophysical and climatic factors. We use a count data approach to model deliberately set fires in Galicia, N.W. Spain, where wildfire is a significant threat to forest ecosystems, with nearly 100,000 wildfires recorded during a thirteen-year period (1999e2011). The spatial units of analysis are more than 3600 parishes. Data for the human influences are derived from fine-resolution maps of wildlandeurban interface (WUI), housing spatial arrangements, road density, forest ownership, and vegetation type. We found wildfire risk to be higher where there are human populations and development/urbanisation pressure, as well as in unattended forest areas due to both rural exodus and a fragmented forest ownership structure that complicates the profitability of forestry practices. To better help direct management efforts, parameter estimates from our model were used to predict wildfire counts under alternative scenarios that account for variation across space on future landuse conditions. Policies that incentivize cooperative forest management and that constrain urban development in wildlands at hotspot fire locations are shown to reduce wildfire risk. Our results highlight the need for spatially targeted fire management strategies.},

Broad-scale prescribed burning is an established, yet controversial, wildfire management policy in Victoria and Australia. But does broad-scale prescribed burning reduce fire damage? The answer depends on how damage is measured. We propose that different perceptions about the efficacy of broad-scale prescribed burning derive from different disciplinary measures of damage (e.g., biodiversity, area burned, or fatalities). Although broad-scale prescribed burning reduces subsequent wildfire size, there is little evidence that it saves human lives and homes. Evidence suggests that small-scale fuel reduction may be more effective at saving lives. The prescribed burning debate might be better focused on what damage we wish to limit, and which measures are most effective at limiting this damage. In this context, the current policy focus on broad-scale prescribed burning targets may distract efforts from more effective lifesaving strategies.},

  abstract = {Wildfire is on the rise. The United States is witnessing a spectacular increase in acres lost to catastrophic wildfires, a phenomenon fed by the generally hotter and dryer conditions associated with climate change. In addition to losses in lives, property, and natural resources, wildfires contribute thousands of tons of air pollution each year. Ironically, one of the most effective tools to reduce the incidence and severity of unplanned wildfires is fire. Prescribed, or controlled, burning reduces the buildup of vegetation resulting from years of wildfire-suppression policy. At present, the number of acres subject to prescribed burns falls far short of the optimal number needed to restore natural ecosystems and reduce damages from unplanned wildfires. Air-pollution law and policy is an important factor contributing to the underprovision of prescribed fire that has so far escaped in-depth treatment in the law and policy literature. After setting forth the relevant air quality framework, this Article argues that decisions regarding planned wildfire are marred by an anachronistic and inaccurate distinction between "natural" and "anthropogenic" fire. Rationalizing that unplanned wildfires are "natural," the federal government excludes pollutants from such fires from air quality compliance calculations at the same time it encourages states to vigorously control pollutants from "anthropogenic," prescribed fires. The result contributes to an undervaluation of  necessary, planned wildfire. Wildfire air pollution policy is also hindered by governance structures that place air quality and resource agencies at odds with each other, and by state nuisance authorities that enable narrow local interests to shut down prescribed fire, all of which trump the broader public interest in reduced wildfire risk and healthier forests. This Article suggests several solutions to remove these distortions, including adopting a default rule whereby all wildfire smoke, of whatever origin, "counts" for purposes of air quality compliance. Together with adopting mechanisms to require air pollution and resource agencies to both participate in planned burning decisions and de-emphasize the influence of nuisance standards, this "smoke is smoke" rule will ensure that the air pollution policy better reflects the true costs and benefits of prescribed fire.},

  abstract     = {Managing natural processes at the landscape scale to promote forest health is important, especially in the case of wildfire, where the ability of a landowner to protect his or her individual parcel is constrained by conditions on neighboring ownerships. However, management at a landscape scale is also challenging because it requires cooperation on plans and actions that cross ownership boundaries. Cooperation depends on people’s beliefs and norms about reciprocity and perceptions of the risks and benefits of interacting with others. Using logistic regression tests on mail survey data and qualitative analysis of interviews with landowners, we examined the relationship between perceived wildfire risk and cooperation in the management of hazardous fuel by nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners in fire-prone landscapes of eastern Oregon. We found that NIPF owners who perceived a risk of wildfire to their properties, and perceived that conditions on nearby public forestlands contributed to this risk, were more likely to have cooperated with public agencies in the past to reduce fire risk than owners who did not perceive a risk of wildfire to their properties. Wildfire risk perception was not associated with past cooperation among NIPF owners. The greater social barriers to private–private cooperation than to private–public cooperation, and perceptions of more hazardous conditions on public compared with private forestlands may explain this difference. Owners expressed a strong willingness to cooperate with others in future cross-boundary efforts to reduce fire risk, however. We explore barriers to cooperative forest management across ownerships, and identify models of cooperation that hold potential for future collective action to reduce wildfire risk.},

Three aspects are central: resilience, adaptability and transformability. These aspects interrelate across multiple scales. Resilience in this context is the capacity of a SES to continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds. Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social–ecological transitions. Society must seriously consider ways to foster resilience of smaller more manageable SESs that contribute to Earth System resilience and to explore options for deliberate transformation of SESs that threaten Earth System resilience.},

  abstract     = {Prescribed burning is a widely accepted wildfire hazard reduction technique; however, knowledge of its effectiveness remains limited. To address this, we employ simulations of a widely used fire behaviour model across the ecologically diverse Australian island state of Tasmania. We simulate three broad scenarios: (1) no fuel treatment, (2) a maximal treatment, with the most possible prescribed burning within ecological constraints, and (3) 12 hypothetically more implementable state-wide prescribed-burning plans. In all simulations, we standardised fire-weather inputs to represent regionally typical dangerous fire-weather conditions. Statistical modelling showed that an unrealistically large maximal treatment scenario could reduce fire intensity in three flammable vegetation types, and reduce fire probability in almost every vegetation type. However, leverage analysis of the 12 more-realistic implementable plans indicated that such prescribed burning would have only a minimal effect, if any, on fire extent and that none of these prescribed-burning plans substantially reduced fire intensity. The study highlights that prescribed burning can theoretically mitigate wildfire, but that an unrealistically large area would need to be treated to affect fire behaviour across the island. Rather, optimisation of prescribed burning requires careful landscape design at the local scale. Such designs should be based on improved fire behaviour modelling, empirical measurement of fuels and analysis of actual wildfires.},

  abstract     = {Wildland fire emissions degrade air quality and visibility, having adverse economic, health and visibility impacts at large spatial scales globally. Air quality regulations can constrain the goals of landscape resilience and management of fire-dependent ecosystems. Here, we review the air quality regulatory framework in the United States, comparing this framework with that of Australia. In the United States, wildland fire management and air quality policies have evolved independently, yet interact to meet diverse public needs. Australian policy development is more recent and decentralised. We find that (1) for maxiumum effectiveness, smoke and fire regulatory frameworks must keep pace with scientific evidence, environmental and social change, and be accompanied by clear regulatory guidance; (2) episodic, non-stationary qualities of fire, and its role in ecosystems, pose specific challenges to regulators and policy-makers; and (3) the complexity of industry-focused air quality policies often leads to unintended consequences for fire management. More research is needed to create and implement more effective fire and air policies and better prepare social-ecological systems to address the challenges of climate change mitigation. These insights may be helpful for countries initially developing complementary fire and air policies, especially as the role of fire becomes more important geopolitically and globally.},

  abstract     = {Background: Global environmental change is exacerbating human vulnerability to adverse atmospheric conditions including air pollution, aeroallergens such as pollen, and extreme weather events. Public information and advisories are a central component of responses to mitigate the human impacts of environmental hazards. Digital technologies are emerging as a means of providing personalised, timely and accessible warnings. Method: We describe AirRater, an integrated online platform that combines symptom surveillance, environmental monitoring, and notifications of changing environmental conditions via a free smartphone app. It was developed and launched in Tasmania, Australia (population 510 000), with the aim of reducing health impacts and improving quality of life in people with conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. We present environmental data, user uptake and results from three online evaluation surveys conducted during the first 22 months of operation, from October 2015 through August 2017. Results: There were 3,443 downloads of the app from all regions of Tasmania. Of the 1,959 individuals who registered, 79\% reported having either asthma or allergic rhinitis. Downloads increased during adverse environmental conditions and following publicity. Symptom reports per active user were highest during spring (72\%), lowest in autumn (37\%) and spiked during periods of reduced air quality. In response to online surveys, most users reported that the app was useful and had improved their understanding of how environmental conditions affect their health, and in some cases had prompted action such as the timely use of medication. Conclusion: Active engagement and consistent positive feedback from users demonstrates the potential for considerable individual, clinical and wider public health benefits from integrated and personalised monitoring systems such as AirRater. The perceived health benefits require objective verification, and such systems need to address several challenges in providing timely, reliable and valid environmental data.},

  abstract     = {Designing fire management regulations is a challenging task given the spatial and temporal variation of climate conditions. Using the burning calendar, a fire management tool to prevent forest fires in Mexico, we assessed the temporal and spatial overlap between this regulation, climate variability and fire use in Calakmul, Mexico. Based on technical recommendations and fieldwork, we defined ranges of wind speed, relative humidity and rainfall that are needed for burning. We studied how these conditions varied over periods of 10 to 50+ years based on meteorological records in 5 locations. Participant observation of agricultural burns and interviews with community leaders and government officials allowed us to study the challenges of following regulations. Results indicate that during the legal time to burn, from 4 to 11am, there is, on average, only 1h with suitable climate conditions for agricultural fire. Farmers burn in the afternoon, when moisture is lower, increasing the chances of successful agricultural burns to 25\% and up to 80\% compared to morning conditions. However, in the afternoon, wind speed tends to increase, elevating the likelihood of uncontrolled secondary fires. In terms of seasonality, the period to burn is suitable for some years in some locations but it is not infallible. Environmental rules aimed at fire management must be sensitive to local climate variations in order to achieve both wildfire prevention and support livelihood systems relying on fire. Rules that do not correspond to the physical context are not only less likely to be followed, but are not legitimate to actors whose behaviors are intended to be regulated.},

  abstract     = {With air quality, liability, and safety concerns, prescribed burning and managed wildfire are often considered impractical treatments for extensive fuels reduction in western US forests. For California's Sierra Nevada forests, we evaluated the alternative and analyzed the amount and distribution of constraints on mechanical fuels treatments on USDA Forest Service land. With the use of current standards and guides, feedback from practicing silviculturists, and GIS databases, we developed a hierarchy of biological (i.e., nonproductive forest), legal (i.e., wilderness), operational (i.e., equipment access), and administrative (i.e., sensitive species and riparian areas) constraints. Of the Sierra Nevada Bioregion's 10.7 million acres in USDA Forest Service ownership, 58\% contains productive forest and 25\% is available to mechanical treatment. National forests in the southern Sierra Nevada have higher levels of constraint due to more wilderness and steeper, more remote terrain. We evaluated different levels of operational constraints and found that increasing road building and operating on steeper slopes had less effect on increasing mechanical access than removing economic considerations (i.e., accessing sites regardless of timber volume). Constraints due to sensitive species habitat and riparian areas only reduced productive forest access by 8\%. We divided the Sierra Nevada Bioregion into 710 subwatersheds (mean size of 22,800 acres) with \&gt;25\% Forest Service ownership as an approximation of a relevant management planning unit for fire or “fireshed.” Only 20\% of these subwatersheds had enough unconstrained acreage to effectively contain or suppress wildfire with mechanical treatment alone. Analysis suggests mechanical treatment in most subwatersheds could be more effective if it established a fuel-reduced “anchor” from which prescribed and managed fire could be strategically expanded. With potential future increases in wildfire size and severity, fire policy and forest restoration might benefit if mechanical thinning is more widely used to leverage and complement managed fire.},

  abstract     = {1. A fire history (1980 to the present) developed for Kakadu National Park, derived mostly from manual interpretation of LANDSAT MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS) imagery, was used as the temporal basis for undertaking rapid assessment of the effects of fire regimes on floristically diverse vegetation containing many regionally endemic species, occupying sandstone formations of the Arnhem Plateau, monsoonal northern Australia. 2. Three broad vegetation types were identified through TWINSPAN classification of floristic composition at 108 sample plots: Allosyncarpia-dominated closed forest; open forest/woodland savanna with an annual grass understorey; and open shrubby heath interspersed with perennial hummock grasses. All sampled vegetation occurred on freely draining, oligotrophic substrates derived from sandstone parent materials; grazing and browsing of sampled vegetation were not significant factors. 3. The three fire frequency parameters derived from the assembled fire history ('years unburnt', 'fire frequency', 'shortest interfire interval') were autocorrelated. Correlative analyses between vegetation structure and soil nutrient variables, and 'years unburnt', demonstrated generally increasing shrub densities, fuel loads and soil fertilities with increasing time since last burnt. Identified limitations m assembled data included: substantial between-plot structural variation for respective vegetation types, reflecting diverse ecological and fire histories of individual plots; and inability to describe accurately the important fire regime variable 'fire intensity' from the imagery used. 4. Assessment of the reproductive maturity of obligate seeder shrub species indicated that, whereas vegetation at some sites could tolerate burning after 3-year intervals without loss of floristic diversity, many species required fire-free intervals of more than 5 years, particularly those occupying harsher, rocky sites. In contrast, fine grass and litter fuels were sufficient to support intense fires in all representative situations under late dry season climatic conditions within 1-3 years of having been burnt previously. 5. Published fire history data for the period 1980-94 show that 40\% of vegetation occupying sandstone-derived landforms in Kakadu National Park have been burnt at frequencies of at least 1 in 3 years; such fire frequencies evidently cannot be sustained without substantial loss of obligate seeder species, comprising 54\% of the sampled shrubby heath flora. The data support other observations concerning the catastrophic impact of contemporary fire regimes on fire-sensitive vegetation types in other sandstone regions of northern and north-western Australia. 6. Based on these insights, an established programme for strategic fire management of the Arnhem Plateau is outlined.},

  abstract     = {The current conditions of many seasonally dry forests in the western and southern United States, especially those that once experienced low- to moderate-intensity fire regimes, leave them uncharacteristically susceptible to high-severity wildfire. Both prescribed fire and its mechanical surrogates are generally successful in meeting short-term fuel-reduction objectives such that treated stands are more resilient to high-intensity wildfire. Most available evidence suggests that these objectives are typically accomplished with few unintended consequences, since most ecosystem components (vegetation, soils, wildlife, bark beetles, carbon sequestration) exhibit very subtle effects or no measurable effects at all. Although mechanical treatments do not serve as complete surrogates for fire, their application can help mitigate costs and liability in some areas. Desired treatment effects on fire hazards are transient, which indicates that after fuel-reduction management starts, managers need to be persistent with repeated treatment, especially in the faster-growing forests in the southern United States.},

  abstract     = {With the potential for worsening fire conditions, discussion is escalating over how to best reduce effects on urban communities. A widely supported strategy is the creation of defensible space immediately surrounding homes and other structures. Although state and local governments publish specific guidelines and requirements, there is little empirical evidence to suggest how much vegetation modification is needed to provide significant benefits. We analysed the role of defensible space by mapping and measuring a suite of variables on modern pre-fire aerial photography for 1000 destroyed and 1000 surviving structures for all fires where homes burned from 2001 to 2010 in San Diego County, CA, USA. Structures were more likely to survive a fire with defensible space immediately adjacent to them. The most effective treatment distance varied between 5 and 20 m (16–58 ft) from the structure, but distances larger than 30 m (100 ft) did not provide additional protection, even for structures located on steep slopes. The most effective actions were reducing woody cover up to 40\% immediately adjacent to structures and ensuring that vegetation does not overhang or touch the structure. Multiple-regression models showed landscape-scale factors, including low housing density and distances to major roads, were more important in explaining structure destruction. The best long-term solution will involve a suite of prevention measures that include defensible space as well as building design approach, community education and proactive land use planning that limits exposure to fire.},

  abstract = {This report will help the Tasmanian community be better prepared for, respond to and recover from natural
disasters through an updated understanding and awareness of the natural hazards that have the most potential to impact the State.
The information contained in this report, including the risk register and risk treatment options together with the accompanying all hazard summary report, can be used by stakeholders and practitioners throughout the emergency management sector to inform emergency management planning.
This report assesses the State level risks posed by Bushfire, Flood, Severe Storm, Landslide, Tsunami, Earthquake, Heatwave, Coastal Inundation and Pandemic Influenza.
Bushfire remains the greatest aggregated risk to Tasmania. It is a ‘High’ or ‘Extreme’ risk across all sectors of society, often with catastrophic consequences expected every 30 years (i.e. ‘Unlikely’ likelihood). This likelihood is expected to become more frequent with climate change.
Land-use planning and building systems are strong and effective controls for each of the hazards apart from
Pandemic Influenza. Limiting future development and vulnerability in known ‘at risk’ areas is considered to be the most effective way of protecting life and property while limiting future government liability.
A ‘multi-hazards’ approach to exercises and business continuity planning within government was agreed to be an important treatment option, with hazard-specific training recommended for key incident management personnel (e.g. incident controllers) as well as formalising the arrangements to guide decision-makers in times of crisis to ensure rapid decision.},

  abstract = {Australia has committed to substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) achieved through a national emissions trading system, raising important issues for relatively undeveloped regions of Northern Australia and, in particular, Indigenous lands. Can mostly Indigenous and socio-economically disadvantaged people living in such regions develop institutions to contribute significantly to the mitigation of GHGE, yet pursue regional development? Will national policies adequately recognise the special needs and potential contributions of such communities? These questions and the challenges inherent in them are addressed in this article with reference to a significant initiative involving the community management of landscape fire to reduce annual GHGE from savanna burning. This initiative appears to offer potential for engagement with global carbon markets, but it will need local, national and international support, along with appropriate changes in attitudes and legal arrangements, to ensure an equitable distribution of tangible rewards, while protecting the cultural and related benefits of customary fire use.

  abstract     = {Prescribed fire is widely viewed as a useful but risky ecosystem management tool, and liability is a crucial issue for prescribed burning on private and public land. Basic liability rules motivate landowners to reduce risk when making choices about the use of fire. Liability therefore influences land use through incentives, and so has important consequences for the larger ecological landscape. Strict liability rules may lead to too little prescribed fire use, while negligence rules may, under certain circumstances, lead to too much. Although prescribed fire provides broad public benefits, such as reduction of wildfire risk or enhanced ecosystem health, the application of liability rules by courts often discourages its use as a vegetation management option. Various approaches exist for improving the laws and regulations surrounding prescribed fire.},
