  abstract = {Summer droughts in North America’s northern Great Plains are expected to increase in frequency and duration as precipitation shifts toward spring and fall. Two rangeland experimental stations in North Dakota experienced drought in 2017 relative to 25-year averages. The southwest location had a 170-mm deﬁcit from the 360-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle (Bos taurus L.) and sheep (Ovis aries L.); the south-central location had 109 mm below the 403-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle. We evaluated patch-burn grazing as a drought resilient land management strategy in the northern Great Plains by comparing average daily gains, fecal density, available forage biomass, and forage crude protein content. At the southwest location, livestock performed better during the drought season compared with animals on the same pastures in the previous year, which had near-normal rainfall but no ﬁre. At the central location, cows on patch-burned pastures performed better than cows on continuously-grazed, unburned pastures in the same year under drought conditions; all cows were nursing calves and calf gains did not vary between treatments. In both locations, the burned patches had higher fecal density and lower available forage biomass than patches not yet burned throughout the grazing season, indicating grazer attraction to burned areas. Despite drought, burned patches maintained grazer attraction and animal performance was maintained or even improved, which contrasts with the expected relationship between animal performance and precipitation. This study indicated that prescribed patch-burning might mitigate drought by buffering forage resources (crude protein content and availability) and maintaining animal performance (average daily gains).},

  abstract = {Plant ecologists have long been interested in the effects of fire on vegetation. Thermocouples have been in their proverbial toolbox for decades, despite temperature not being a direct product or measure of wildland fire behaviour or fire effects. To better represent the cumulative impact of high-temperature exposure on organisms, ecologists often use temperature–time curves from thermocouples to calculate residence time—the duration of heat exposure above a threshold temperature—which can be used to calculate another popular metric, degree  \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds. A systematic literature review of 105 published papers shows that residence time, especially, and degree \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds are common metrics derived from raw temperature–time data. While several errors in thermocouple readings have been previously identified and addressed—responsiveness to heating, discrepancy between thermocouple temperature and actual temperature of the medium surrounding the thermocouple—this paper highlights a previously unconsidered source of error that must be reconciled for metrics like residence time to be biologically valid: the disproportionately long time it takes for thermocouples to cool once heat input is complete. Using an array of thermocouples in a fume hood over a Bunsen burner before and after the flame is extinguished, this paper shows that after being exposed to flame, 30-gauge K-type thermocouples require 80–100 s to register ambient temperatures despite taking only about 5 s to respond to heating. The review indicates ecologists give no consideration for this disproportionately slow cooling response. These findings indicate that residence time (and therefore degree \$\${\textbackslash}cdot \$\$seconds) have been over-estimated in the fire ecology literature. The proposed solution is to simply truncate temperature–time curves at the point temperature begins to decline, which indicates a shift from the biologically relevant effect of heat input to the biologically irrelevant, physical properties (heat diffusivity) of the thermocouple itself. Conceptual models present these biologically relevant portions of the temperature–time curve and identify parts of the biologically relevant curve that might be useful in quantifying components of flammability.},

The importance of elevated below-ground soil temperatures during fires on the survival of grasshopper eggs had not been examined. 2.?The effects of simulated autumn grassland fires of varying intensities on below-ground egg mortality were examined with grasshopper species laying shallow egg pods (Ageneotettix deorum) and deeper egg pods (Melanoplus sanguinipes) to test the hypothesis that exposure to heat during fires was the mechanism responsible for population reductions in A. deorum following fire. 3.?Species-specific oviposition characteristics mediated the effects of fire intensity on below-ground egg mortality. The results indicate that fires occurring in areas with at least 3100 kg ha?1 standing crop biomass would be expected to significantly reduce populations of A. deorum, but not M. sanguinipes. No A. deorum eggs hatched in 12 of the 14 oviposition containers subjected to simulated fires approximating a standing crop biomass of 4500 kg ha?1. This is the first study to link field observations of rangeland insect populations following fire to mechanisms related to below-ground egg mortality.},

  abstract = {Fire is the dominant factor affecting C and N losses from the semiarid forests of the eastern Sierra Nevada. As prescription fire becomes a best management practice, it is critical to develop an estimate of these fluxes. The objectives of this study were (i) to test and refine methods to estimate the volatilized C and N losses from the forest floor following fire, (ii) to investigate the interactions between O-horizon temperature and nutrient loss, and (iii) to assess measured N losses in the context of atmospheric N deposition, leaching, and N fixation. The quantities of C and N volatilized from the forest floor by prescription fire in the Sierra Nevada were measured using two different field-based methods: weight loss estimation and Ca/element ratio determination. Three sites were included in the study: Marlene, Sawtooth and Spooner. The weight method indicated C losses of 6.12, 7.39, and 17.8 Mg C haϪ1 at the Sawtooth, Marlene, and Spooner sites, respectively. The ratio method indicated comparable C losses from the Sawtooth (6 Mg C haϪ1 ) site, but greater losses at Marlene (16 Mg C haϪ1 ) and Spooner (24 Mg C haϪ1 ) sites. The weight method indicated N losses of 56.2, 60.8, and 362 kg N haϪ1, at the Sawtooth, Marlene, and Spooner sites, respectively. The ratio method indicated comparable N losses of 59.9 kg N haϪ1 at the Sawtooth site, but considerably greater losses at Marlene (243 kg N haϪ1 ), and Spooner (524 kg N haϪ1 ) sites. The Ca-element method was preferred because of minimal needs for preburn sampling. Regardless of method, the estimated losses were significant, particularly for N, compared with deposition and leaching rates. Volatilization will represent the major mechanism for N loss from forest ecosystems of this region subjected to prescribed fire.},

  abstract   = {Soils constitute one of the most valuable resources on earth, especially because soil is renewable on human time scales. During the 20th century, a period marked by a widespread rural exodus and land abandonment, ﬁre suppression policies were adopted facilitating the accumulation of fuel in forested areas, exacerbating the effects of wildﬁres, leading to severe degradation of soils. Prescribed ﬁres emerged as an option for protecting forests and their soils from wildﬁres through the reduction of fuels levels. However such ﬁres can serve other objectives, including stimulating the regeneration of a particular plant species, maintaining biological diversity or as a tool for recovering grasslands in encroached lands. This paper reviews studies examining the short- and long- term impacts of prescribed ﬁres on the physical, chemical and biological soil properties; in so doing, it provides a summary of the beneﬁts and drawbacks of this technique, to help determine if prescribed ﬁres can be useful for managing the landscape. From the study conducted, we can afﬁrm that prescribed ﬁres affects soil properties but differ greatly depending on soil initial characteristics, vegetation or type of ﬁre. Also, it is possible to see that soil's physical and biological properties are more strongly affected by prescribed ﬁres than are its chemical properties. Finally, we conclude that prescribed ﬁres clearly constitute a disturbance on the environment (positive, neutral or negative depending on the soil property studied), but most of the studies reviewed report a good recovery and their effects could be less pronounced than those of wildﬁres because of the limited soil heating and lower ﬁre intensity and severity.},

  abstract = {Fire plays a crucial role in mediating species composition in Fescue Prairie. However, previous studies focused on responses of plant community to burning without disentangling the effects of burning on seedling emergence in Fescue Prairie. In this study, seedlings emerging in the field and from soil seed banks incubated in a greenhouse were examined after burning in the spring of 2012 and 2013 near Saskatoon, Canada. Soil seed bank samples were taken from the top 5 cm of the soil profile, separated into litter, 0- to 1-cm soil, and 1- to 5-cm soil layers. In the 2-yr field study, 11 plant families with 1 graminoid and 22 nongraminoids were identified among emerged seedlings. Burning significantly increased the number of 3 native and 1 non-native seedlings emerging, as well as total seedlings emerging from the field in both years (P {\textless} 0.05). Species richness and diversity of seedlings emerging from the field were increased by burning. Species composition of emerged seedlings from the field was significantly altered by burning in 2012 (P = 0.03) and 2013 (P {\textless} 0.01). In the 2-yr soil seed bank study, 19 plant families with 10 graminoids and 56 nongraminoids emerged. Burning had more prominent effects on seedling density of native species and forbs, rather than non-native species and graminoids. Species composition was altered by burning in all studied soil layers (P {\textless} 0.05). Fire appears to stimulate recruitment of some species, especially early seral species, contributing to potential changes in species composition of the Fescue Prairie.},

  abstract  = {Grasslands cover an estimated 31\%–43\% of the Earth’s land surface, possess an intrinsic conservation value, and offer indispensable ecosystem services. However, grasslands have been extensively managed and exploited, face major threats, including land-use change, climate change, woody encroachment, and biological invasion. The primary tools used to sustainably manage grassland soils include prescribed fire, grazing and mowing, and soil amendments. We present four research highlights describing contemporary, leading-edge grassland research examining the importance of plant, soil, and microbial interactions; the underappreciated role of “biocrusts”; and the use of novel crop systems for climate change mitigation. Our synthesis suggests that to sustainably manage grassland soils, we must (1) consider interactions between different above- and belowground ecosystem components; (2) navigate the complex trade-offs produced by different management actions; (3) develop contextual, case-specific best management practices; (4) and integrate the practices of grassland restoration and the sustainable management of grassland soils.},

In rangeland systems, prescribed fire can reduce woody plant encroachment, restore the resilience of native grasslands, and mitigate fuel load accumulation limiting catastrophic wildfires. Yet, many individuals decide against this land management practice. In order to better understand the cognitive decision-making processes that shape the use of prescribed fire in rangeland ecosystems, we conducted 66 semi-structured interviews with key informants in the Texas and Oklahoma portions of the Southern Great Plains. Results indicate that heuristic processes were frequently used when considering the use of prescribed fire, but that analytical processes were more likely to lead to prescribed fire implementation. These findings suggest the need to reframe prescribed fire communications to the public, rethink prescribed fire regulations, and reshape liability insurance for fire practitioners.},

  abstract = {Many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties can be affected by forest fires. The effects are chiefly a result of burn severity, which consists of peak temperatures and duration of the fire. Climate, vegetation, and topography of the burnt area control the resilience of the soil system; some fire-induced changes can even be permanent. Low to moderate severity fires, such as most of those prescribed in forest management, promote renovation of the dominant vegetation through elimination of undesired species and transient increase of pH and available nutrients. No irreversible ecosystem change occurs, but the enhancement of hydrophobicity can render the soil less able to soak up water and more prone to erosion. Severe fires, such as wildfires, generally have several negative effects on soil. They cause significant removal of organic matter, deterioration of both structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilisation, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, and marked alteration of both quantity and specific composition of microbial and soil-dwelling invertebrate communities. However, despite common perceptions, if plants succeed in promptly recolonising the burnt area, the pre-fire level of most properties can be recovered and even enhanced. This work is a review of the up-to-date literature dealing with changes imposed by fires on properties of forest soils. Ecological implications of these changes are described.},

Soils were analyzed for NO3-, NH4+, total N, total C, and C:N responses to the treatments. Ammonium, which was the dominant form of inorganic N, generally increased with greater burn temperatures and durations (interpreted as higher fire severity), but decreased at the highest severity in dry soils. Increasing initial water content (IWC) diminished these responses in one soil but not in the other. Nitrate responses varied between soils, but generally increased with increasing IWC. Little or no change was seen in total N, total C, and C:N ratio except at highest severity, where C and N decreased regardless of initial moisture content. Soil temperatures measured immediately after burning increased with greater applied furnace temperatures and durations to near 100 \textdegree C, leveled off for periods depending on IWC, and then increased to 300 \textdegree C to 400 \textdegree C at higher temperatures and durations. This experiment shows that low-severity fire can cause very large and highly variable changes in NO3- and NH4+, with little or no change in total C or N. High-severity fire has varying effects on NO3- and NH4+, depending on IWC and soil type, but generally causes losses of total C and N.},

We synthesize current knowledge on temporal aspects of plant\textendash soil feedbacks and present new ideas to better understand and predict the effects of plant\textendash soil feedbacks on community and ecosystem properties across temporal scales. Explaining short-term temporal feedback dynamics requires us to better understand mechanistic linkages between plants, soil organisms and locally available resources. On the other hand, we need to refine our understanding of the context-dependency of plant\textendash soil feedbacks, as the strength and direction of feedback interactions are influenced by `external' temporal ecosystem dynamics, such as variation in soil resource availability after disturbance or during succession. Synthesis. Based on our synthesis of temporal aspects of plant\textendash soil feedbacks, we suggest three main avenues for future research: (i) how plant\textendash soil feedbacks changes with ontogeny, (ii) how plant and soil organism traits drive temporal variation in plant\textendash soil feedbacks and (iii) how environmental changes across temporal scales alter the strength and direction of plant\textendash soil feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Fire is a globally important ecosystem process, and invasive grass species generally increase fire spread by increasing the fuel load and continuity of native grassland fuelbeds. We suggest that invasive grasses that are photosynthetically active, while the native plant community is dormant reduce fire spread by introducing high-moisture, live vegetation gaps in the fuelbed. We describe the invasion pattern of a high-moisture, cool-season grass, tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub), in tallgrass prairie, and use spatially explicit fire behavior models to simulate fire spread under several combinations of fuel load, invasion, and fire weather scenarios. Reduced fuel load and increased extent of tall fescue invasion reduced fire spread, but high wind speed and low relative humidity can partially mitigate these effects. We attribute reduced fire spread to asynchrony in the growing seasons of the exotic, cool-season grass, tall fescue, and the native, warm-season tallgrass prairie community in this model system. Reduced fire spread under low fuel load scenarios indicate that fuel load is an important factor in fire spread, especially in invaded fuel beds. These results present a novel connection between fire behavior and asynchronous phenology between invasive grasses and native plant communities in pyrogenic ecosystems.},

Given that healthy soil is necessary to sustain biodiversity, ecosystems and agriculture, the impact of fire on soil is a vital field of research.
Fire Effects on Soil Properties brings together current research on the effects of fire on the physical, biological and chemical properties of soil. Written by over 60 international experts in the field, it includes examples from fire-prone areas across the world, dealing with ash, meso and macrofauna, smouldering fires, recurrent fires and management of fire-affected soils. It also describes current best practice methodologies for research and monitoring of fire effects and new methodologies for future research. This is the first time information on this topic has been presented in a single volume and the book will be an important reference for students, practitioners, managers and academics interested in the effects of fire on ecosystems, including soil scientists, geologists, forestry researchers and environmentalists.},

  abstract = {Field  studies on the effects of heating soil are rare. Studies in which the temperature  was varied and measured are even rarer. To cover this lack of knowledge, we conducted  some experimental fires in which the fuel was controlled to obtain different fire  intensities. Induced temperatures were measured by k-type thermocouples placed at  various soil depths. These induced temperatures were highly variable at the soil  surface, whereas below 2.5-cm depth, the temperature rise was negligible. Modifications  of various soil physico-chemical parameters caused by fire were related to increasing  temperatures at the soil surface. The passage of fire promoted the aggregation of  clay particles into sand-sized particles, which become even more resistant to the  disrupting action of water. The soil pH decreased at temperatures up to 395°C,  followed by a clear increase at higher temperatures; however, both the cation exchange  capacity and the organic matter content decreased continuously with increasing soil  temperature. Total nitrogen content remained surprisingly constant as the soil surface  temperature increased, whereas ammonium nitrogen peaked at 184°C. The organic  phosphorus decreased continuously, and the available fractions increased.
        These  results are in agreement with the results of our previous research on the effects  of the artificial heating on soil properties and confirm that the processes occurring  in soil are related to the temperature reached during the fire. The ashes, at least  immediately after fire, do not affect these processes.},

  abstract     = {Biochar application has become a novel and emergent technology for sequestering C, improving soil quality and crop production, and is a potential winewin strategy for ecosystem service delivery. Biochar addition can also stimulate soil microbial activity, and although it is unclear exactly why biochar should benefit soil microorganisms, it is thought that the large surface area and volume of pores provide a significant habitat for microbes. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial colonisation of wood-derived biochar that had been buried in an agricultural soil for three years. We have examined the level of colonisation on the internal and external surfaces of field-aged biochar by scanning electron microscopy, and used 14C-labelled glucose to quantify the rates of microbial activity in different spatial niches of the biochar and the surrounding soil. Microbial colonisation of field-aged biochar was very sparse, with no obvious differences between the external and internal surfaces. At the high field application rate of 50 t haÀ1, biochar contributed only 6.52 Æ 0.11\% of the total soil pore space and 7.35 Æ 0.81\% of the total soil surface area of the topsoil (0e30 cm). Further, 17.46 Æ 0.02\% of the biochar pores were effectively uninhabitable for most microbes, being {$<$}1 mm in diameter. The initial rate of microbial mineralization of 14C-labelled glucose was significantly greater in the control bulk soil and the soil immediately surrounding the biochar than on the biochar external and internal surfaces. However, lower C use efficiency values of microbes on, or within, the biochar also suggested lower available C status or differences in the structure of the microbial community in the biochar relative to the surrounding soil. This study suggests that, at least in the short term ( 3 y), biochar does not provide a significant habitat for soil microbes. While biochar is extremely recalcitrant and largely unavailable to soil microbes, changes in soil physicochemical properties and the introduction of metabolically available labile compounds into the surrounding soil (the ‘charosphere’) may significantly alter soil microbial activity and structure, which could ultimately affect soileplantemicrobe interactions. Therefore, before the wide-scale application of biochar to agricultural land is exploited, it is important that we understand further how the properties of biochar positively or negatively affect soil microbial communities, and in turn, how they interact with, and colonise biochar.},
