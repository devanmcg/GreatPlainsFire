  abstract = {Summer droughts in North America’s northern Great Plains are expected to increase in frequency and duration as precipitation shifts toward spring and fall. Two rangeland experimental stations in North Dakota experienced drought in 2017 relative to 25-year averages. The southwest location had a 170-mm deﬁcit from the 360-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle (Bos taurus L.) and sheep (Ovis aries L.); the south-central location had 109 mm below the 403-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle. We evaluated patch-burn grazing as a drought resilient land management strategy in the northern Great Plains by comparing average daily gains, fecal density, available forage biomass, and forage crude protein content. At the southwest location, livestock performed better during the drought season compared with animals on the same pastures in the previous year, which had near-normal rainfall but no ﬁre. At the central location, cows on patch-burned pastures performed better than cows on continuously-grazed, unburned pastures in the same year under drought conditions; all cows were nursing calves and calf gains did not vary between treatments. In both locations, the burned patches had higher fecal density and lower available forage biomass than patches not yet burned throughout the grazing season, indicating grazer attraction to burned areas. Despite drought, burned patches maintained grazer attraction and animal performance was maintained or even improved, which contrasts with the expected relationship between animal performance and precipitation. This study indicated that prescribed patch-burning might mitigate drought by buffering forage resources (crude protein content and availability) and maintaining animal performance (average daily gains).},

  abstract   = {Soils constitute one of the most valuable resources on earth, especially because soil is renewable on human time scales. During the 20th century, a period marked by a widespread rural exodus and land abandonment, ﬁre suppression policies were adopted facilitating the accumulation of fuel in forested areas, exacerbating the effects of wildﬁres, leading to severe degradation of soils. Prescribed ﬁres emerged as an option for protecting forests and their soils from wildﬁres through the reduction of fuels levels. However such ﬁres can serve other objectives, including stimulating the regeneration of a particular plant species, maintaining biological diversity or as a tool for recovering grasslands in encroached lands. This paper reviews studies examining the short- and long- term impacts of prescribed ﬁres on the physical, chemical and biological soil properties; in so doing, it provides a summary of the beneﬁts and drawbacks of this technique, to help determine if prescribed ﬁres can be useful for managing the landscape. From the study conducted, we can afﬁrm that prescribed ﬁres affects soil properties but differ greatly depending on soil initial characteristics, vegetation or type of ﬁre. Also, it is possible to see that soil's physical and biological properties are more strongly affected by prescribed ﬁres than are its chemical properties. Finally, we conclude that prescribed ﬁres clearly constitute a disturbance on the environment (positive, neutral or negative depending on the soil property studied), but most of the studies reviewed report a good recovery and their effects could be less pronounced than those of wildﬁres because of the limited soil heating and lower ﬁre intensity and severity.},

  abstract = {Many physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological soil properties can be affected by forest fires. The effects are chiefly a result of burn severity, which consists of peak temperatures and duration of the fire. Climate, vegetation, and topography of the burnt area control the resilience of the soil system; some fire-induced changes can even be permanent. Low to moderate severity fires, such as most of those prescribed in forest management, promote renovation of the dominant vegetation through elimination of undesired species and transient increase of pH and available nutrients. No irreversible ecosystem change occurs, but the enhancement of hydrophobicity can render the soil less able to soak up water and more prone to erosion. Severe fires, such as wildfires, generally have several negative effects on soil. They cause significant removal of organic matter, deterioration of both structure and porosity, considerable loss of nutrients through volatilisation, ash entrapment in smoke columns, leaching and erosion, and marked alteration of both quantity and specific composition of microbial and soil-dwelling invertebrate communities. However, despite common perceptions, if plants succeed in promptly recolonising the burnt area, the pre-fire level of most properties can be recovered and even enhanced. This work is a review of the up-to-date literature dealing with changes imposed by fires on properties of forest soils. Ecological implications of these changes are described.},

Soils were analyzed for NO3-, NH4+, total N, total C, and C:N responses to the treatments. Ammonium, which was the dominant form of inorganic N, generally increased with greater burn temperatures and durations (interpreted as higher fire severity), but decreased at the highest severity in dry soils. Increasing initial water content (IWC) diminished these responses in one soil but not in the other. Nitrate responses varied between soils, but generally increased with increasing IWC. Little or no change was seen in total N, total C, and C:N ratio except at highest severity, where C and N decreased regardless of initial moisture content. Soil temperatures measured immediately after burning increased with greater applied furnace temperatures and durations to near 100 \textdegree C, leveled off for periods depending on IWC, and then increased to 300 \textdegree C to 400 \textdegree C at higher temperatures and durations. This experiment shows that low-severity fire can cause very large and highly variable changes in NO3- and NH4+, with little or no change in total C or N. High-severity fire has varying effects on NO3- and NH4+, depending on IWC and soil type, but generally causes losses of total C and N.},

We suggest that invasive grasses that are photosynthetically active, while the native plant community is dormant reduce fire spread by introducing high-moisture, live vegetation gaps in the fuelbed. We describe the invasion pattern of a high-moisture, cool-season grass, tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub), in tallgrass prairie, and use spatially explicit fire behavior models to simulate fire spread under several combinations of fuel load, invasion, and fire weather scenarios. Reduced fuel load and increased extent of tall fescue invasion reduced fire spread, but high wind speed and low relative humidity can partially mitigate these effects. We attribute reduced fire spread to asynchrony in the growing seasons of the exotic, cool-season grass, tall fescue, and the native, warm-season tallgrass prairie community in this model system. Reduced fire spread under low fuel load scenarios indicate that fuel load is an important factor in fire spread, especially in invaded fuel beds. These results present a novel connection between fire behavior and asynchronous phenology between invasive grasses and native plant communities in pyrogenic ecosystems.},

These fires affect the properties of soils and the processes by which they form, but the nature of these impacts has not been well understood. Given that healthy soil is necessary to sustain biodiversity, ecosystems and agriculture, the impact of fire on soil is a vital field of research.
Fire Effects on Soil Properties brings together current research on the effects of fire on the physical, biological and chemical properties of soil. Written by over 60 international experts in the field, it includes examples from fire-prone areas across the world, dealing with ash, meso and macrofauna, smouldering fires, recurrent fires and management of fire-affected soils. It also describes current best practice methodologies for research and monitoring of fire effects and new methodologies for future research. This is the first time information on this topic has been presented in a single volume and the book will be an important reference for students, practitioners, managers and academics interested in the effects of fire on ecosystems, including soil scientists, geologists, forestry researchers and environmentalists.},

  abstract = {Field  studies on the effects of heating soil are rare. Studies in which the temperature  was varied and measured are even rarer. To cover this lack of knowledge, we conducted  some experimental fires in which the fuel was controlled to obtain different fire  intensities. Induced temperatures were measured by k-type thermocouples placed at  various soil depths. These induced temperatures were highly variable at the soil  surface, whereas below 2.5-cm depth, the temperature rise was negligible. Modifications  of various soil physico-chemical parameters caused by fire were related to increasing  temperatures at the soil surface. The passage of fire promoted the aggregation of  clay particles into sand-sized particles, which become even more resistant to the  disrupting action of water. The soil pH decreased at temperatures up to 395°C,  followed by a clear increase at higher temperatures; however, both the cation exchange  capacity and the organic matter content decreased continuously with increasing soil  temperature. Total nitrogen content remained surprisingly constant as the soil surface  temperature increased, whereas ammonium nitrogen peaked at 184°C. The organic  phosphorus decreased continuously, and the available fractions increased.
        These  results are in agreement with the results of our previous research on the effects  of the artificial heating on soil properties and confirm that the processes occurring  in soil are related to the temperature reached during the fire. The ashes, at least  immediately after fire, do not affect these processes.},

  abstract     = {Biochar application has become a novel and emergent technology for sequestering C, improving soil quality and crop production, and is a potential winewin strategy for ecosystem service delivery. Biochar addition can also stimulate soil microbial activity, and although it is unclear exactly why biochar should benefit soil microorganisms, it is thought that the large surface area and volume of pores provide a significant habitat for microbes. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial colonisation of wood-derived biochar that had been buried in an agricultural soil for three years. We have examined the level of colonisation on the internal and external surfaces of field-aged biochar by scanning electron microscopy, and used 14C-labelled glucose to quantify the rates of microbial activity in different spatial niches of the biochar and the surrounding soil. Microbial colonisation of field-aged biochar was very sparse, with no obvious differences between the external and internal surfaces. At the high field application rate of 50 t haÀ1, biochar contributed only 6.52 Æ 0.11\% of the total soil pore space and 7.35 Æ 0.81\% of the total soil surface area of the topsoil (0e30 cm). Further, 17.46 Æ 0.02\% of the biochar pores were effectively uninhabitable for most microbes, being {$<$}1 mm in diameter. The initial rate of microbial mineralization of 14C-labelled glucose was significantly greater in the control bulk soil and the soil immediately surrounding the biochar than on the biochar external and internal surfaces. However, lower C use efficiency values of microbes on, or within, the biochar also suggested lower available C status or differences in the structure of the microbial community in the biochar relative to the surrounding soil. This study suggests that, at least in the short term ( 3 y), biochar does not provide a significant habitat for soil microbes. While biochar is extremely recalcitrant and largely unavailable to soil microbes, changes in soil physicochemical properties and the introduction of metabolically available labile compounds into the surrounding soil (the ‘charosphere’) may significantly alter soil microbial activity and structure, which could ultimately affect soileplantemicrobe interactions. Therefore, before the wide-scale application of biochar to agricultural land is exploited, it is important that we understand further how the properties of biochar positively or negatively affect soil microbial communities, and in turn, how they interact with, and colonise biochar.},
