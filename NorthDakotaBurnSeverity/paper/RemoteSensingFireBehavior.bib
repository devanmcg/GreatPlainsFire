  abstract = {We present TerraClimate, a dataset of high-spatial resolution (1/24{$^\circ$}, {\textasciitilde}4-km) monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958--2015. TerraClimate uses climatically aided interpolation, combining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the WorldClim dataset, with coarser resolution time varying (i.e., monthly) data from other sources to produce a monthly dataset of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure, and solar radiation. TerraClimate additionally produces monthly surface water balance datasets using a water balance model that incorporates reference evapotranspiration, precipitation, temperature, and interpolated plant extractable soil water capacity. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time varying climate and climatic water balance data. We validated spatiotemporal aspects of TerraClimate using annual temperature, precipitation, and calculated reference evapotranspiration from station data, as well as annual runoff from streamflow gauges. TerraClimate datasets showed noted improvement in overall mean absolute error and increased spatial realism relative to coarser resolution gridded datasets.},

Over a range of bark moistures (28\%--83\%) and bole diameters (3--20 cm), depth of necrosis appears to be primarily a function of fire intensity, flame residence time at the stem, and the corresponding time-integrated heat flux at the bark surface. Our results, along with known relations between bole diameter and bark thickness, and improved models of fire behavior and heat transfer, may be useful for estimating tree mortality resulting from prescribed fires.},

  abstract = {The maximum temperatures of thermocouples, temperature-sensitive paints, and calorimeters exposed to flames in wildland fires are often called ``fire temperatures'' but are determined as much by the properties and deployment of the measurement devices as by the fires themselves. Rather than report device temperatures that are not generally comparable among studies, we show that maximum and time-integrated temperatures of relatively thick (4.8 mm diameter) type-K thermocouple probes (TCPs) can be calibrated to estimate fuel consumption and fire line intensity in surface fires. Although reporting standard fire characteristics is an improvement over reporting device temperatures, TCPs are not ideal instruments for monitoring surface fires, because they provide only point estimates of fire behavior and must be calibrated for different fire environments, TCP characteristics, and deployments. To illustrate how TCPs respond to fires and to point the way towards a more general calibration method, we report results from a numerical model that accurately simulated TCP response to a spreading surface fire.

We compared the impacts of four fuel treatments on fire severity, including two thin-only, a thin-burn, a burn-only, and an untreated control. We evaluated four fire severity metrics---tree mortality, average bole char height, percent crown volume consumed (PCVC), and percent crown volume affected (PCVA)---and leveraged data from pre-fire surface and canopy fuels to better understand the mechanisms driving differences in wildfire severity among treatments and how they changed with fire weather.},

  abstract = {A field deployable system for quantifying energy and mass transport in wildland fires is described. The system consists of two enclosures: The first is a sensor/data logger combination package that allows characterization of convective/radiant energy transport in fires. This package contains batteries, a programmable data logger, sensors, and other electronics. The standard sensors consist of radiometers that measure total and radiant energy fluxes, a small-gauge thermocouple that senses flame and air temperature, and probes that sense the magnitude and direction of airflow before, during, and after the fire passes. The second is a fire proof enclosure housing a video camera. The boxes have a double lens configuration with the exterior lens consisting of high temperature glass and the interior lens consisting of coated glass that reflects infrared radiation (heat), while allowing visible light to pass through. The cameras can either be turned on manually or can be set to trigger and record through a wireless link to the data loggers. The system has been used extensively in full scale wildland fires. Analysis of the visual video images provides an objective method for measuring flame height, flame length, flame depth, flame angle and fire rate of spread. Typically each sensor package is coupled with a video package for simultaneous recording of video and in-situ measurements allowing researchers to better evaluate fire behavior measurements relative to flame size and local spread rate. The camera images can provide estimates of flame height, depth, angle and fire rate of spread.},

  abstract = {For most of the 20th century and beyond, national wildland fire policies concerning fire suppression and fuels management have primarily focused on forested lands. Using summary statistics and landscape metrics, wildfire spatial patterns and trends for non-forest and forest burned area over the past two decades were examined across the U.S, and federal agency jurisdictions. This study found that wildfires burned more area of non-forest lands than forest lands at the scale of the conterminous and western U.S. and the Department of Interior (DOI). In an agency comparison, 74\% of DOI burned area occurred on non-forest lands and 78\% of U.S. Forest Service burned area occurred on forested lands. Landscape metrics revealed key differences between forest and non-forest fire patterns and trends in total burned area, burned patch size, distribution, and aggregation over time across the western U.S. Opposite fire patterns emerged between non-forest and forest burns when analyzed at the scale of federal agency jurisdictions. In addition, a fire regime departure analysis comparing current large fire probability with historic fire trends identified certain vegetation types and locations experiencing more fire than historically. These patterns were especially pronounced for cold desert shrublands, such as sagebrush where increases in annual area burned, and fire frequency, size, and juxtaposition have resulted in substantial losses over a twenty-year period. The emerging non-forest fire patterns are primarily due to the rapid expansion of non-native invasive grasses that increase fuel connectivity and fire spread. These invasions promote uncharacteristic frequent fire and loss of native ecosystems at large-scales, accelerating the need to place greater focus on managing invasive species in wildland fire management. Results can be used to inform wildfire management and policy aimed at reducing uncharacteristic wildfire processes and patterns for both non-forest and forest ecosystems as well as identify differing management strategies needed to address the unique wildfire issues each federal agency faces.},

We analyzed the predictive accuracy of models currently used operationally in Australia for predicting fire spread rates in five different fuel types (grasslands, temperate and semi-arid shrublands, dry eucalypt and conifer forests) compared to their previous counterparts. We calculated error statistics and contrasted model predictions against observed spread rates of field observations of wildfires and prescribed fires. We then compared the changes in error metrics of older models to newer ones. Evaluation results show newer models to have improved prediction accuracy. Mean absolute errors were reduced by 56\%, 68\% and 70\% in dry eucalypt forests, grasslands and crown fires in conifer forests, respectively. The most significant improvement was the reversion of under-prediction bias achieved with newer models. This study has highlighted the value of continuous improvement when it comes to developing operational wildland fire spread models.},

Thus, we investigated whether vegetation gaps (bare soil patches) influence the survival of exposed seeds during fire events in the Cerrado by serving as safe sites. We performed field fire experiments in Central Brazil to examine how gap size (\% of bare soil) influences fire heat (fire temperatures and residence time) and seed survival (Experiment 1) and to determine how seed survival is affected by fixed conditions: gaps vs grass tussocks during fires (Experiment 2). We used seeds of two common Cerrado legumes, Mimosa leiocephala Benth. and Harpalyce brasiliana Benth. Seed survival was analysed using GLMMs with a binomial distribution. In Experiment 1, seeds survived (38 and 35\% for M. leiocephala and H. brasiliana respectively) only when the gaps had {$>$}40\% of bare soil. In Experiment 2, all seeds under grass tussocks died when exposed to fire, whereas up to 40\% of seeds survived in vegetation gaps, relative to their respective controls. Because vegetation gaps influence fire heat, they are important as safe sites for seed survival in the Cerrado, allowing a significant proportion of seeds to survive when exposed at the soil surface.},

  abstract = {We use two rate-process models to describe cell mortality at elevated temperatures as a means of understanding vascular cambium cell death during surface fires. In the models, cell death is caused by irreversible damage to cellular molecules that occurs at rates that increase exponentially with temperature. The models differ in whether cells show cumulative effects of heating. The temperature dependencies of the models' rate parameters were estimated from cell-count data after exposing live-bark tissues from four Canadian Rocky Mountain tree species to a range of fixed temperatures in a water bath. Based on both models, lodgepole pine's (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) growing season vascular cambium cells experienced lower mortality rates at elevated temperatures than those of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Growing and dormant season differences were marginal. With reservations for lodgepole pine, both models predicted cell survival after exposures to rising and falling temperatures such as would be experienced by live tissues during fires. A simulation involving conduction heat transfer from flames and vascular cambium cell mortality suggests that differences among species in thermal tolerance are small compared with the effects of bark thickness. Although stem vascular cambium cell mortality was complete when tissues reached 60 "C during simulated surface fires, it may not be warranted to apply the 60 "C threshold to other tissues exposed to contrasting temperature regimes during fires.

Land management agencies have responded by increasing the use of prescribed fire and thinning. However, given the continued emphasis on fire suppression, current levels of funding for such fuel management practices are unlikely to maintain the status quo, let alone reverse the effects of fire exclusion. We suggest an alternative approach to wildfire management, one that places less emphasis on suppression and instead encourages managers to balance short-term wildfire damages against the long-term consequences of fire exclusion. However, any major change in wildfire management, such as the one proposed here, will shift the costs and benefits of wildfire management, inevitably raising opposition.},

We show, using a fungal rDNA metabarcoding approach (Illumina MiSeq), that the fungal community composition was influenced by fire regime (frequency) but not time-since-fire. Fungal community composition was resilient to direct fire effects, most likely because grassland fires transfer little heat to the soil. Differences in the fungal community composition due to fire regime was likely due to associated changes that occur in vegetation with recurrent fire, via the break up of obligate symbiotic relationships. However, fire history only partially explains the observed dissimilarity in composition among the soil samples, suggesting a distinctiveness in composition in each grassland site. The importance of considering changes in soil microbe communities when managing vegetation with fire is highlighted.}

For this purpose, three fires occurring in southern Spain were studied. Firstly, the displacements of burned and unburned pixels in the pre-/post-fire NIR-MIR and NIR-R bi-spectral spaces were analysed with the aim of establishing which of the two indices was the most sensitive for discriminating severity levels. Then, the capacity of the two indices, both from a uni-temporal (post-fire) and bi-temporal perspective (pre and post-fire), to discriminate three severity levels was studied. Based on the results, it was decided that the most suitable way to assess wildfire severity by index segmentation was to discriminate between unburned and burned pixels according to their NBR pre-/post-fire difference values (dNBR), and, subsequently, to distinguish between pixels with an extreme and moderate severity based on the NBR post-fire values. The thresholds calculated for these indices permitted fire severity mapping with an accuracy of 86.42\% ({\textpm}4.31\%). These thresholds could be extrapolated to other fires with similar characteristics although a calculation of their own specific thresholds could improve the accuracy of the fire severity map obtained.},

Computer simulation, case studies, and analysis of the fire regime in the presence of active prescribed burning programs in forest and shrubland generally indicate that this fuel management tool facilitates fire suppression efforts by reducing the intensity, size and damage of wildfires. However, the conclusions that can be drawn from the above approaches are limited, highlighting the need for more properly designed experiments addressing this question. Fuel accumulation rate frequently limits prescribed fire effectiveness to a short post-treatment period (2--4 years). Optimisation of the spatial pattern of fire application is critical but has been poorly addressed by research, and practical management guidelines are lacking to initiate this. Furthermore, adequate treatment efforts in terms of fire protection are constrained by operational, social and ecological issues. The best results of prescribed fire application are likely to be attained in heterogeneous landscapes and in climates where the likelihood of extreme weather conditions is low. Conclusive statements concerning the hazard-reduction potential of prescribed fire are not easily generalised, and will ultimately depend on the overall efficiency of the entire fire management process.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to assess the spatial patterns of temperature distribution at the soil surface after a shrubland fire in a typical Mediterranean environment. The study was carried out by making experimental fires at a permanent field station (La Concordia, Valencia, Spain) in a typical Mediterranean forest slope. The set up consisted of nine plots (20 m long{\texttimes}4 m wide) with similar morphology, slope gradient, rock outcrops, soil (Rendzic Leptosol) and vegetation cover (Rhamno lycioidis--Quercetum cocciferae association). Two different fire severities were evaluated, high (F1) and moderate (F2), created by the addition of limited amounts of biomass. To measure soil temperatures, two complementary methods were used: thermocouples and thermosensitive paints. Results show that peak temperatures on the soil surface measured by the two systems (higher than 600 {$^\circ$}C in most cases) are quite similar and there are no statistically significant differences between them. The mean values of soil surface temperatures measured with thermosensitive paints were 240, 239 and 218 {$^\circ$}C for F1 plots and 418, 448 and 435 {$^\circ$}C for F2 plots. Half of the F1 plots surface showed temperature values between 170 and 235 {$^\circ$}C, and in the F2 plots, these values ranged between 322 and 543 {$^\circ$}C. Geostatistics were applied to analyze and describe the spatial variation of soil temperatures at the soil surface. Results showed that there are two dominant spatial patterns of temperature distribution (spherical and linear). The spherical model varied approximately between 4 and 10 m, and its pattern is related mainly to the natural biomass distribution and the time of flame persistence. In the second, the linear pattern, the temperature rise from the lower part to the upper part of the plot seems to be controlled by the meteorology at the time of burning, mainly by wind speed and wind direction. The spatial patterns of soil temperatures during the studied experimental fires affect soil properties in different ways according to the fire severity. This fact could contribute to change the spatial dynamics of soil nutrients that will play an important role in the recovery of the burned vegetation.},

  abstract = {An understanding of fire behaviour and its impacts on natural ecosystems is essential for developing management strategies, specifically for planning prescribed fires. It is well known that vegetation and microclimate factors are important predictors of fire behaviour. However, the relative importance of these factors and how fire behaviour responds to changes in these factors are still understood, especially in the Brazilian Cerrado, which has strong seasonality and high vegetation heterogeneity. Here, we compiled literature data from 65 experimental fire plots in three vegetation types in the Cerrado biome---grasslands, savannas, and forests---corresponding to a gradient of increasing of woody cover. First, we evaluated how aspects of fire behaviour (fire spread rate, fire intensity, and heat released) and of fire-associated emissions (fine fuel consumption, combustion factor, and carbon emissions associated with fine fuel consumption) vary according to vegetation type. Subsequently, we evaluated the relative importance of vegetation (represented by woody cover and fine fuel load) and microclimatic factors (represented by vapour pressure deficit [VPD] and wind speed) in determining the fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions. Using generalised linear models, we evaluated the simultaneous influences of vegetation and microclimate variables (only for independent and non-collinear variables) on fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions. We found that aspects of fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions differed among the vegetation types: compared to forests, grasslands and savannas showed higher fire spread rates and fire intensities, consumed more fine fuel biomass, had larger combustion factors, released more heat, and emitted more carbon. The results show that the vegetation type, VPD and fine fuel load are key metrics for explain fire behaviour and fire-associated emissions in the Cerrado. The VPD was found to be the primary driver of the fire spread rate and fire intensity for all vegetation types and fine fuel load was the primary driver of heat released, fine fuel consumption, combustion factor, and carbon emissions in all vegetation types.},

The recovery of large soil animal communities after fires is therefore dependent on the spatial structure of the burned habitats. The role of locally less disturbed sites in the survival of soil macrofauna communities along with traditionally considered immigration from the surrounding undisturbed habitats is shown by the example of burnt areas located in three geographically distant regions of European Russia. Such unburned soil cover sites (perfugia) occupy 5--10\% of the total burned habitats. Initially, perfugia are characterized by much higher (200--300\% of the average across a burned area) diversity and abundance of soil fauna. A geostatistical method made it possible to estimate the perfugia size for soil macrofauna at 3--8 m.},

Three study areas in southern Ohio oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) forests were established with four treatment areas of {$\sim$}20 ha each: control (C), burn only (B), thin only (T) or thin plus burn (TB). Two independent measures useful for qualitatively characterising fire intensity were established on a 50-m grid, resulting in over 120 sampling locations at each site, in the burned areas: aluminum tags painted with temperature-sensitive paints, and logger-probe units that logged probe temperature every 2 s during burns. Fires were conducted in spring 2001. The logger-probe units allowed five measures qualitatively related to fire intensity or timing to be calculated at each grid point: maximum probe temperature; duration of probe temperature above 30{\textopenbullet}C; a heat index, defined as the summed temperatures above 30{\textopenbullet}C; time of maximum temperature; and estimated rate of spread. Maximum temperatures recorded by the two measuring systems were highly correlated (r2 = 0.83). Relative to painted tags, logger-probe units provide information useful for assessing some other components of fire behaviour. The temporal recording of temperatures allowed us to prepare a web-based simulation of the fires. Heat index and rate of spread estimates provided additional fire information. The TB units consistently burned cooler than the B units, perhaps because of uncured slash and a disrupted fuel bed in those units.},

  abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

  abstract = {Ecological definition and detection of fire severity are influenced by factors of spatial resolution and timing. Resolution determines the aggregation of effects within a sampling unit or pixel (alpha variation), hence limiting the discernible ecological responses, and controlling the spatial patchiness of responses distributed throughout a burn (beta variation). As resolution decreases, alpha variation increases, extracting beta variation and complexity from the spatial model of the whole burn. Seasonal timing impacts the quality of radiometric data in terms of transmittance, sun angle, and potential contrast between responses within burns. Detection sensitivity can degrade toward the end of many fire seasons when low sun angles, vegetation senescence, incomplete burning, hazy conditions, or snow are common. Thus, a need exists to supersede many rapid response applications when remote sensing conditions improve. Lag timing, or time since fire, notably shapes the ecological character of severity through first-order effects that only emerge with time after fire, including delayed survivorship and mortality. Survivorship diminishes the detected magnitude of severity, as burned vegetation remains viable and resprouts, though at first it may appear completely charred or consumed above ground. Conversely, delayed mortality increases the severity estimate when apparently healthy vegetation is in fact damaged by heat to the extent that it dies over time. Both responses depend on fire behavior and various species-specific adaptations to fire that are unique to the pre-fire composition of each burned area. Both responses can lead initially to either over- or underestimating severity. Based on such implications, three sampling intervals for short-term burn severity are identified; rapid, initial, and extended assessment, sampled within about two weeks, two months, and depending on the ecotype, from three months to one year after fire, respectively. Spatial and temporal conditions of sampling strategies constrain data quality and ecological information obtained about fire severity. Though commonly overlooked, such considerations determine the objectives and hypotheses that are appropriate for each application, and are especially important when building comparative studies or long-term reference databases on fire severity.},

In the present study we examined the process of curing with specific consideration of changes in fuel structure that will affect potential fire behaviour. Our sampling protocol expanded the fuel component groups from two (live and dead) to four (green, senescing, new dead and old dead fuel). We found that all these components had significant fuel moisture content differences, thereby justifying our sampling protocol. Visual curing assessment predominantly resulted in an over-prediction bias of curing level and failed to capture the effect of the senescing process on fuel availability to combust due to misclassification of fuel components (e.g. senescing fuels with high fuel moisture content were classified as dead fuels because of their colouration). Models were developed to estimate the: (1) proportion of senescing and green fuels from knowledge of the current year's dead fuel proportion; and (2) actual curing level from fuel moisture content and soil dryness level.},

Rangelands vary in climate and are often subject to disturbances like drought and wildfire. Historic wildfire trends have indicated an increase in wildfire size and frequency, raising societal and ecological concerns about the management of these lands, both pre- and post-wildfire. While there has been investigation into the effects of grazing prior to a wildfire on fire severity and plant mortality, there is limited research related to grazing post-wildfire even though current management paradigms suggest deferring grazing rangeland for two years after a wildfire to avoid additional stress on native plant species. Based on the diversity found across rangeland ecotypes and history with wildfire, the two-year deferment recommendation may need to be reconsidered for some ecosystems. Species found in perennial bunchgrass rangelands like Pseudoroegneria spicata (bluebunch wheatgrass) and Festuca idahoensis (Idaho fescue) may be less susceptible to post-fire grazing than initially thought, necessitating the need for research into different rangeland ecosystems.},

As with any derived data, it is critical to understand inherent limitations to maximise the utility of the dataset without compromising the inferences. The classified severity product in particular is of limited use to research due to a lack of both consistency in developing class thresholds and empirical relationships with ecological metrics. Here we review the products available and their development process, and characterise and quantify the limitations of the classified burn severity data product based on the use of highly variable and subjective classification thresholds. We suggest a framework for overcoming these limitations by developing a more robust classified product that will support ecological management and applications. This framework utilises field data to develop consistent, ecologically based thresholds that incorporate existing ecoregion classifications from LANDFIRE or other fire management frameworks already widely integrated into planning efforts.},

The scientific literature has repeatedly reported that prescribed fire is often the most effective means of achieving such goals by reducing fuels and wildfire hazard and restoring ecological function to fire-adapted ecosystems in the United States (US) following a century of fire exclusion. This has translated into calls from scientists and policy experts for more prescribed fire, particularly in the Western US, where fire activity has escalated in recent decades. The annual extent of prescribed burning in the Western US remained stable or decreased from 1998 to 2018, while 70\% of all prescribed fire was completed primarily by non-federal entities in the Southeastern US. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was the only federal agency to substantially increase prescribed fire use, potentially associated with increased tribal self-governance. This suggests that the best available science is not being adopted into management practices, thereby further compounding the fire deficit in the Western US and the potential for more wildfire disasters.},

Meeting this challenge will lay the foundation for predicting direct ecological effects of fires and fire--atmosphere coupling. In this paper, we focus on the relationships between the fire radiation field, as measured from the zenith, fuel consumption and the behaviour of spreading flame fronts. Experiments were conducted in 8 {\^A} 8-m outdoor plots using preconditioned wildland fuels characteristic of mixed-oak forests of the eastern United States. Using dual-band radiometers with a field of view of ,18.5 m2 at a height of 4.2 m, we found a nearlinear increase in fire radiative energy density over a range of fuel consumption between 0.15 and 3.25 kg m{\`A}2. Using an integrated heat budget, we estimate that the fraction of total theoretical combustion energy density radiated from the plot averaged 0.17, the fraction of latent energy transported in the plume averaged 0.08, and the fraction accounted for by the combination of fire convective energy transport and soil heating averaged 0.72. Future work will require, at minimum, instantaneous and time-integrated estimates of energy transported by radiation, convection and soil heating across a range of fuels.},

  abstract = {The use of bare bead thermocouples for temperature measurement in combustion environments is widespread due to the low cost, robustness and ease of use of such a type of device. It is however well known that temperatures monitored with thermocouples can be significantly affected by radiation errors. This in turn implies to properly estimate the energy losses induced by this phenomenon so as to get a consistent estimate of the true temperature of the investigated medium. The present paper thus aims to rule on the relative efficiency of four different compensation techniques including the electrical compensation (EC), the reduced radiative error (RRE), the extrapolation and the multi-element ones. To do so, an original set of temperature measurements carried out in a fully characterized flat flame reactor has been acquired. The comparison of the above-listed correction approaches has moreover been supported by comprehensive sensitivity analyses dealing with the influence of parameters like the composition of the surrounding atmosphere, the local velocity, the Nusselt number correlation or the emissivity of the thermocouple junction on the predicted radiation corrections. The main conclusions drawn through this study coupling experimental approaches and theoretical calculations show that EC and RRE methods can lead to globally converging trends provided that some thermo-physical parameters integrated into the calculation of the RRE correction coefficient are correctly assessed. The extrapolation approach tends to predict radiation losses similar to those derived from the EC and RRE techniques while the multi-element strategy significantly diverges from the other ones probably due to its very important sensitivity to raw temperature values.},

Such events are associated with warmer and drier fire seasons and are expected to increase in the future. Our understanding of the landscape outcomes of extreme events is limited, particularly regarding whether they burn more severely or produce spatial patterns less conducive to ecosystem recovery. To assess relationships between fire spread rates and landscape burn severity patterns, we used satellite fire detections to create day-of-burning maps for 623 fires comprising 4267 single-day events within forested ecoregions of the southwestern United States. We related satellite-measured burn severity and a suite of high-severity patch metrics to daily area burned. Extreme fire spread events (defined here as burning {$>$} 4900 ha/day) exhibited higher mean burn severity, a greater proportion of area burned severely, and increased like adjacencies between high-severity pixels. Furthermore, increasing daily area burned also resulted in greater distances within high-severity patches to live tree seed sources. High-severity patch size and total high-severity core area were substantially higher for fires containing one or more extreme spread events than for fires without an extreme event. Larger and more homogenous high-severity patches produced during extreme events can limit tree regeneration and set the stage for protracted forest conversion. These landscape outcomes are expected to be magnified under future climate scenarios, accelerating fire-driven forest loss and long-term ecological change.},

  abstract = {Fire is widely understood to be an important ecological process in grasslands around the world, but little research has been done on soil heating and nutrient and microbe responses to prescribed fire in the northern Great Plains of North America. We investigated plant-available nitrogen responses to soil heating in semi-arid grassland in southwestern North Dakota, USA. We sought to describe the range of temperatures reached at the soil surface and in the plant canopy during five prescribed burns, measure ammonium NH4+ and nitrate NO3- responses to soil heating, and explore relationships between soil heating, nutrient responses, and temperature profiles below the soil surface. We also used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) markers to measure soil microbial abundance and community composition responses to fire. We observed statistically-significantly higher NH4+ immediately (1~day) after burns and statistically-significantly higher NO3- 7~months after burns, which follows the pattern for each N species widely described in the literature. The abundance and community composition of soil microbes were both unchanged by fire. Soil heating models indicate that the highest temperatures (above 100{$^\circ$}C) were limited to the top 2~cm. Together, these data suggest well-managed prescribed fire plays an important role in enhancing ecological function of managed grasslands by releasing nutrients and promoting nutrient cycling without contributing to soil degradation.},

  abstract = {This study describes spatial and temporal patterns in fire across the US Western Great Plains over the last 40 years. Although pyrogeographic studies have explored the nexus of fire patterns in relation to the bio-physical environment and socio-ecological trends, most of this research has focused on forested ecosystems and regions long known for conflict between wildfires and human development, especially at the wildland--urban interface. But evidence suggests large wildfire activity is increasing in the US Great Plains, and the Western Great Plains---a Land Resource Region comprised of four ecoregions, Northwestern Plains, High Plains, Nebraska Sandhills, and Southwestern Tablelands---not only contains some of the largest areas of rangeland in the US but also the highest concentration of public land in the Great Plains. As such, the Western Great Plains provides an opportunity to explore fire activity in primarily rural landscapes with a combination of public and private ownership, all dominated by rangeland vegetation. We combined several publicly-available datasets containing fire records between 1992 and 2020 to create two databases, one with georeferenced point data on 60,575 wildfire events in the region, and another with georeferenced perimeter data for 2665 fires. Ignition by humans was the dominant cause of fires. No ecoregion showed a statistically significant trend towards either increasing or decreasing the annual burned area. The Northwestern Plains had the most burned area and the greatest number of incidents---consistently around or above 1000 incidents per year since 1992---with the majority in July. The High Plains showed the greatest increase in annual fire incidence, never reaching more than 200--300 per year 1992--2009, and averaging above 1000 incidents per year since 2010. Few long-term trends in human population, weather, or fuel metrics appear strongly associated with fire patterns in any ecoregion, although the years 2006, 2012, and 2017 stood out for their levels of fire activity, and these years often frequently logged extreme values in wildland fuel metrics. These relationships merit much closer examination in the Western Great Plains, because like other rangeland-dominated landscapes, the fine fuels that comprise these wildland fuelbeds are much more responsive to fine-scale changes in moisture conditions. Rural Western Great Plains landscapes are a mosaic of public and private land ownership, and an increasing impact of wildfires on public grazing lands---which are often situated within other jurisdictions or ownership---will likely have an impact on rural livelihoods.},

In many North American grasslands, late growing season burns re-introduce fire to periods most prone to lightning-driven fire prior to wildfire suppression policies. We report here on restoring summer fire in central North Dakota, USA, from a research project in which summer burns were only completed in two out of four years for which summer burns were planned. We use remotely-sensed imagery and local weather data to assess whether fuel or weather conditions limited burning in the summer, and to compare fire environmental conditions and subsequent burn severity across prescribed burns conducted in the spring and summer. Finally, we review historical data to determine if conditions have changed in either the spring or summer burn seasons over 42 years. Although burn severity generally declined with fuelbed greenness in the spring, summer burns could effect as high of severity as spring burns despite having greener fuelbeds. What little phenological change seems to have occurred at the study location over 42 years---slightly greener fuelbeds and slightly lower relative humidity in spring---likely offset each other to some degree. Overall, we found little evidence that being able to complete summer burns was anomalous, and conclude that it is reasonable for managers to incorporate late growing season fire into prescribed fire programs with the caveat that some summers will simply be too wet and/or too green to burn.},

Rangelands are heterogeneous natural ecosystems in which spatial heterogeneity can be attributed to inherent variability due to soils, topography, and hydrology, or disturbances such as fire and grazing. But little research has directly compared the relative contributions of inherent heterogeneity and disturbance to spatial variability. Here, variance partitioning is used to parse the relative contributions of inherent heterogeneity described in soil maps, and disturbance-driven heterogeneity imposed by patch burns, in grazed mixed-grass prairie of the US Northern Great Plains. Results support the hypothesis that disturbance-driven heterogeneity overrides inherent heterogeneity. Specifically, on pastures without patch burns, aboveground plant biomass depended on inherent variability in soil and topographic position; on patch-burned pastures, aboveground plant biomass was driven by time-since-fire and plant successional stages. Variability in forage nutritive composition and the spatial distribution of grazers were also driven by patchiness when imposed by spatially-discrete fire, while the role of inherent heterogeneity was weak for both. These results provide evidence for a default, often weak bottom--up control of spatial heterogeneity in the absence of spatially-discrete disturbance that can be overridden by top--down disturbance effects.},

This variability is not well described by a single metric (e.g. mean load), so quantifying traits such as variability, continuity and spatial arrangement will help more precisely describe surface fuels. This study measured surface fuel variability in the northern Sierra Nevada of California following a high-severity fire that converted a mixed-conifer forest to shrub-dominant vegetation, both before and after a subsequent shrub removal treatment conducted as site preparation for reforestation. Data were collected on vegetation composition, spatial arrangement and biomass load of the common surface fuel components (1--1000-h woody fuel, litter, duff and shrubs). Mean shrub patch length decreased significantly from 9.25 to 1.0 m and mean dead and down surface fuel load decreased significantly from 131.4 to 73.4 Mg ha-1. Additionally, probability of encountering a continuous high fuel load segment decreased after treatment. This work demonstrates a method of quantifying important spatial characteristics of surface fuel that could be used in the next generation of fire behaviour models and provides metrics that land managers may consider when designing post-fire reforestation treatments.},

  abstract = {The overall effects of {\textregistered}re on ecosystems are complex, ranging from the reduction or elimination of aboveground biomass to impacts on belowground physical, chemical and microbial mediated processes. Since a key component of overall ecosystem sustainability occurs belowground, recovery is tied to the soil's physical, chemical, and biological functions and processes. Depending on several {\textregistered}re severity measures, changes in belowground components can be either bene{\textregistered}cial or deleterious to the entire ecosystem. Low-impact burning can promote a herbaceous {\textasciimacron}ora, increase plant available nutrients, and thin overcrowded forests, all of which can foster healthy systems. Severe {\textregistered}res can often cause changes in successional rates, alter above- and belowground species composition, generate volatilization of nutrients and ash entrainment in smoke columns, produce rapid or decreased mineralization rates, alter C : N ratios, and result in subsequent nutrient losses through accelerated erosion, leaching or denitri{\textregistered}cation. In addition, changes in soil hydrologic functioning, degradation of soil physical properties, decreases in micro- and macrofauna, and alterations in microbial populations and associated processes can occur. The direct effect of {\textregistered}re on belowground systems is a result of the burning severity, which integrates aboveground fuel loading (live and dead), soil moisture and subsequent soil temperatures, and duration of the burn. The time for recovery of belowground systems will not only depend on the burning intensity and its effect on key ecosystem processes and components, but also on the previous land-use practices. Thus, the impacts of {\textregistered}re on belowground systems can be highly variable and may not be predictable. Our paper is a general review of the effects of {\textregistered}re on belowground systems with emphasis placed on the changes in physical, biogeochemical and biological properties of soils and the resulting consequences these changes have for ecosystem sustainability.

  abstract = {Purpose of Review The search for causal mechanisms in fire ecology has been slow to progress for two main reasons. First, many fire ecology investigations often occur after fires, with no detailed information on fire behavior. These fire effects are then used to infer both fire behavior and the subsequent effects themselves. Second, that fire behavior is heterogeneous at many scales both spatially and temporally, and that heat transfer occurs in three dimensions is only now being appreciated. Spatially and temporally resolved measurement of heat and mass transport in fires is difficult; and even when fire is measured, it is often measured in ways that are not relevant to the effects of interest. General measurements like flame length, rate of spread, and consumption are only approximate descriptors of a complicated energy transfer environment and are of limited use when linking fires to their effects. Recent Findings We review both progress in biophysical fire ecology and present recent advances in technology and analytical techniques used for measuring the fire environment. We discuss not only how models of fire-induced injury can be partitioned into belowground, stems, and crowns but also how understanding synergy among these injuries will be necessary to improve our understanding of fire effects. We also present how there are emerging opportunities to apply computational fluid dynamic models to address issues of scaling in biophysical fire effects.},

However, the natural role of fire has been disrupted in many regions due to the influence of human activities, which have the potential to either exclude or promote fire, resulting in a ``fire deficit'' or ``fire surplus'', respectively. In this study, we developed a model of expected area burned for the western US as a function of climate from 1984 to 2012. We then quantified departures from expected area burned to identify geographic regions with fire deficit or surplus. We developed our model of area burned as a function of several climatic variables from reference areas with low human influence; the relationship between climate and fire is strong in these areas. We then quantified the degree of fire deficit or surplus for all areas of the western US as the difference between expected (as predicted with the model) and observed area burned from 1984 to 2012. Results indicate that many forested areas in the western US experienced a fire deficit from 1984 to 2012, likely due to fire exclusion by human activities. We also found that large expanses of non-forested regions experienced a fire surplus, presumably due to introduced annual grasses and the prevalence of anthropogenic ignitions. The heterogeneity in patterns of fire deficit and surplus among ecoregions emphasizes fundamentally different ecosystem sensitivities to human influences and suggests that large-scale adaptation and mitigation strategies will be necessary in order to restore and maintain resilient, healthy, and naturally functioning ecosystems.},

Ash thickness measurements were conducted along two transects (flat and sloping areas) following a grided experimental design. In order to interpolate data with accuracy and identify the techniques with the least bias, several interpolation methods were tested in the grided plot. Overall, the fire had a low severity. However, the fire significantly reduced the ground cover, especially on sloping areas, owing to the higher fire severity and/or less biomass previous to the fire. Ash thickness depended on fire severity and was thin where fire severity was higher and thicker in lower fire severity sites. The ash thickness decreased with time after the fire. Between 4 and 16 days after the fire, ash was transported by wind. The greatest reduction took place between 16 and 34 days after the fire as a result of rainfall, and was more efficient where fire severity was higher. Between 34 and 45 days after the fire, no significant differences in ash thickness were identified among ash colours and only traces of the ash layer remained. The omni-directional experimental variograms showed that variable structure did not change significantly with time. The ash spatial variability increased with time, particularly on the slope, as a result of water erosion.},

Because of their effects on fire behaviour, aspect, steepness and heterogeneity of topography favoured higher fire severity on slope B than on slope A. Three different slope positions were identified on slope A -- flat top, middle slope and flat bottom -- and five on slope B -- flat top, middle slope, flat middle slope, slope bottom slope and flat bottom. Fire severity was high in top slope positions. The recovery of vegetation was very fast. By the end of the study, vegetation covered nearly 100\% of the study area, although fire severity, aspect and slope characteristics had implications on vegetation recovery. Plant cover recovered quickly on slope A. Ten and 17 days after the fire, plant cover was high in the bottom positions, where fire severity was relatively low.

The benefits and shortcomings of each type of model are considered with reference to specific examples of each type. It is shown that there are problems with current operational models which restrict their effective use. However, the development of rigorous physical models as replacements is impeded by conceptual and practical difficulties. Accurate estimation of the rate of spread and the intensity of a fire allows prediction of the final shape and area of a fire event. The modelling techniques used to estimate the shape and area of a fire are considered including the development of sophisticated computerbased simulations of fire spread. Spatial information technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) offer great potential for the effective modelling of wildland fire behaviour. While such spatial information technologies have been frequently used in the evaluation of fire danger risk, their use for the simulation of the spatiotemporal behaviour of wildland fire is not common. The way in which spatial information technologies and decisionsupport systems are used for fire risk evaluation and fire spread simulation is discussed. Two research areas of great importance if fire modelling techniques are to improve are a better understanding of fire-dependent phenomena and the development of a `new generation' of fire spread models; current trends in these areas of research are evaluated.},

  abstract = {Soil heating caused by prescribed or wildland fire commonly focuses on a single biological thermal threshold of 60 {$^\circ$}C for the duration of one minute to represent organism death. This metric severely misrepresents the heterogeneity of the soil environment, the physiological attributes and tolerances of organisms, and the complexity of heat transfer through soils. Measurements of biotic death in simulated laboratory experiments render research findings difficult to extrapolate to forest and grassland soils. The disparity between assumed biological responses and the diversity of biological responses after wildland fire events calls for a thorough review of soil biological heating thresholds. In this review, we synthesize and compare research that directly relates soil heating temperature and duration to biological responses, provide relevant models for temperature-duration responses of soil organisms in lieu of a strict threshold, and recommend applications of soil heating data for wildland fire and ecosystem management. For no single study or group of organisms was a threshold of 60 {$^\circ$}C for one-minute duration evidenced. All soil organisms reviewed, which included roots, mesofauna, bacteria, fungi, microbial biomass, and soil respiration, displayed both positive and negative responses to soil heating across temperature and duration gradients. We, therefore, discourage the use of the traditionally accepted metric of 60 {$^\circ$}C for the duration of one minute. Instead, we present models of duration-temperature relationships of soil biota and invite interdisciplinary efforts from researchers and managers to directly measure biological responses on a case-bycase basis.},

  abstract = {The fire-grazing interaction is well studied in mesic grasslands worldwide, but research is limited in semiarid systems. We examined the principal drivers and feedbacks of the fire-grazing interaction on the strength of cattle grazing selection, herbaceous biomass, crude protein, and vegetation structure and composition in two pastures in the Northern Great Plains. Cattle showed significant preference, use, and grazing utilization in recently burned patches that declined as time since fire increased. Cattle selection was driven by significantly increased crude protein in recent burns. Grazing utilization of 70\% in patches with b 1 yr after fire established low herbaceous biomass, but the extent to which it was maintained varied with precipitation. Herbaceous biomass increased to nonburned levels 2 yr after fire, and crude protein decreased to nonburned levels 120 d after fire. Species composition was influenced primarily by site and year, though bare ground and litter were influenced by the fire-grazing interaction. Our data indicate that mixed-grass prairies of the Northern Great Plains are resilient to the fire-grazing interaction and that rest from grazing following fire is likely ecologically unnecessary. The use of the fire-grazing interaction is an alternative management strategy suitable for the Northern Great Plains, effectively increasing heterogeneity of grassland habitat.},

This essay examines the ways in which fire has functioned intellectually in Western civilization as mythology, as religion, as natural philosophy and as modern science. The great phase change occurred with the development of industrial combustion; fire faded from quotidian life, which also removed it from the world of informing ideas. Beginning with the discovery of oxygen, fire as an organizing concept fragmented into various subdisciplines of natural science and forestry. The Anthropocene, however, may revive the intellectual role of fire as an informing idea or at least a narrative conceit.

  abstract = {Rangeland extent is an important factor for evaluating critical indicators of rangeland sustainability. Rangeland areal extent was determined for the coterminous United States in a geospatial framework by evaluating spatially explicit data from the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) project describing historic and current vegetative composition, average height, and average cover through the viewpoints of the Natural Resources Inventory (NRI) administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program administered by the US Forest Service. Three types of rangelands were differentiated using the NRI definition encompassing rangelands, afforested rangelands, and transitory rangelands. Limitations in the FIA definition permitted characterization of only two rangeland types: rangeland and rangeland vegetation with a small patch size. These classes were similar to those from the NRI definition but differed in tree canopy cover threshold requirements. Estimated rangeland area resulting from the NRI- and FIA-LANDFIRE models were 268 and 207 Mha, respectively. In addition, the NRI-LANDFIRE model identified 19 Mha of afforested rangelands due principally to encroachment and increased density by species classified as trees belonging to the genera Quercus, Prosopis, and Juniperus. The biggest discrepancies between acreage estimates derived from NRI- and FIA-LANDFIRE models occurred in oak, pinyon-juniper, and mesquite woodlands. The differences in area estimates between the NRI and FIA perspectives demonstrate the need for development of unified, objective methods for determining rangeland extent that can be applied consistently to all rangelands regardless of ownership or jurisdiction. While the models and geospatial information developed here are useful for national-scale estimates of rangeland extent, they are subject to the limitations of the LANDFIRE data products.},

To address this knowledge gap, we stacked logs to create `mega-log' burning conditions and compared the temperature, duration and penetration of the soil heat pulse in nine high intensity burned (HB) plots paired with adjacent masticated and broadcast burned low intensity burned (LB) plots at different soil depths (0, 5, 10 and 30 cm) in a Pinus ponderosa stand with volcanic pumice soils. Maximum soil surface temperatures ranges were 424--11688C with a mean and standard error of 759 {\AE} 98C in the HB treatment and 42--3608C (107 {\AE} 438C) in the LB treatment. In the HB treatment, temperatures causing fine root and soil organism mortality (.608C) penetrated the soil to at least 10 cm, but were not recorded at 30 cm. In the HB treatment, mean duration above 608C at 0--10 cm persisted for 4--13 h (7.61 {\AE} 1.02 h). Soils in the LB treatment experienced lethal temperatures at the surface for about an hour (1.19 {\AE} 0.70 h) and at 5 cm were mostly well below lethal temperatures with the exception of one at 578C and another at 1008C that remained above 608C for 1.4 h.

An alternative pathway to evaluate fire severity that bridges fire combustion dynamics and ecophysiology via dose--response experiments is presented. We provide an illustrative example from a controlled nursery combustion laboratory experiment. In this example, severity is defined through changes in the ability of the plant to assimilate carbon at the leaf level. We also explore changes in the Differenced Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (dNDVI) and the Differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) as intermediate spectral indices. We demonstrate the potential of this methodology and propose dose--response metrics for quantifying severity in terms of carbon cycle processes.},

Vegetation structure is an ecosystem property influenced by management that has site selection and use implications for wildlife and livestock. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to increase structural heterogeneity on semi-arid post-Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands in southwestern North Dakota. Location Hettinger Research Extension Center in Hettinger, North Dakota. Methods We surveyed plant community composition and structural characteristics in patch-burn grazing pastures during the 2017--2020 summer grazing seasons. Three pastures were stocked with cow-calf pairs and three were stocked with sheep. We also surveyed structural characteristics on units with conventional management (hay or idle) for active and post-CRP enrolled grasslands during the summers of 2018--2020. We tested for vegetative and structural differences between patches with varying time since fire and between grazer types on patch-burn pastures using mixed-effect models and ordination. We used variance partitioning to determine if structural contrast on patch-burn pastures increased over the study period and if structural contrast was higher on patch-burn grazing pastures relative to conventional management. Results Time since fire was significant for all structural characteristics, with recently burned patches being different from other patches. There were no structural differences between cattle and sheep pastures, but forb and legume cover were lower in sheep pastures. Structural contrast on patch-burn pastures increased over the study and was greater than conventional management. Conclusions Increased structural heterogeneity is important for supporting a broad suite of rangeland wildlife and can stabilize forage production. This study supports the expectation that patch-burn grazing with moderate stocking rates will increase structural contrast regardless of grazer type, but practitioners should consider which suites of species that management may benefit.},

  abstract = {Wildfire plays an important role in ecosystem dynamics, land management, and global processes. Understanding the dynamics associated with wildfire, such as risks, spatial distribution, and effects is important for developing a clear understanding of its ecological influences. Remote sensing technologies provide a means to study fire ecology at multiple scales using an efficient and quantitative method. This paper provides a broad review of the applications of remote sensing techniques in fire ecology. Remote sensing applications related to fire risk mapping, fuel mapping, active fire detection, burned area estimates, burn severity assessment, and post-fire vegetation recovery monitoring are discussed. Emphasis is given to the roles of multispectral sensors, lidar, and emerging UAS technologies in mapping, analyzing, and monitoring various environmental properties related to fire activity. Examples of current and past research are provided, and future research trends are discussed. In general, remote sensing technologies provide a low-cost, multi-temporal means for conducting local, regional, and global-scale fire ecology research, and current research is rapidly evolving with the introduction of new technologies and techniques which are increasing accuracy and efficiency. Future research is anticipated to continue to build upon emerging technologies, improve current methods, and integrate novel approaches to analysis and classification.},

  abstract = {The fire history of the northern Great Plains has been largely reconstructed from the historical record. To clarify this history, segments of 1-m cores from four lakes in North and South Dakota and northeastern Montana were examined for charcoal fragments. The cores spanned a time interval of 172 to 380 yr. Samples integrating 5-10 yr of deposition were taken from 2-cm sections along each core and sieved. Charcoal concentrations ranged from 6-14,799 fragments/gram of sediment, and mean charcoal abundance was negatively correlated with longitude. Results suggest periods of increased fire from A.D. 1700-1740 and A.D. 1850-1900. These peaks were broadly synchronous across the region and ranged in duration from 20-40 yr. Postsettlement patterns of charcoal deposition were highly variable but generally much lower than presettlement intervals.},

  abstract = {The temporal dimension of differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) fire/burn severity studies was studied for the case of the large 2007 Peloponnese wildfires in Greece. Fire severity is defined as the degree of environmental change as measured immediately post-fire, whereas burn severity combines the direct fire impact and ecosystems responses. Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI), two pre-/post-fire differenced Thematic Mapper (TM) dNBR assessments and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dNBR time series were used to analyze the temporal dimension. MODIS dNBR time series were calculated based on the difference between the NBR of the burned and control pixels, which were retrieved using time series similarity of a pre-fire year. The analysis incorporated the optimality statistic, which evaluates index performance based on displacements in the mid-infrared--near infrared bi-spectral space. Results showed a higher correlation between field and TM data early post-fire (R2=0.72) than one-year post-fire (R2=0.56). Additionally, mean dNBR (0.56 vs. 0.29), the dNBR standard deviation (0.29 vs. 0.19) and mean optimality (0.65 vs. 0.47) were clearly higher for the initial assessment than for the extended assessment. This is due to regenerative processes that obscured first-order fire effects impacting the suitability of the dNBR to assess burn severity in this case study. This demonstrates the importance of the lag timing, i.e. time since fire, of an assessment, especially in a quickly recovering Mediterranean ecosystem. The MODIS time series was used to study intra-annual changes in index performance. The seasonal timing of an assessment highly impacts what is actually measured. This seasonality affected both the greenness of herbaceous resprouters and the productivity of the control pixels, which is land cover specific. Appropriate seasonal timing of an assessment is therefore of paramount importance to anticipate false trends (e.g. caused by senescence). Although these findings are case study specific, it can be expected that similar temporal constraints affect assessments in other ecoregions. Therefore, within the limitations of available Landsat imagery, caution is recommended for the temporal dimension when assessing post-fire effects. This is crucial, especially for studies that aim to evaluate trends in fire/burn severity across space and time. Also, clarification in associated terminology is suggested.},

  abstract = {A vast area (more than 100 000 ha) of forest, shrubs and agricultural land burned on the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece during the 2007 summer. Three pre- and post-fire differenced Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-derived spectral indices were correlated with field data of burn severity for these devastating fires. These spectral indices were the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR). The field data consist of 160 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) plots. In addition, indices were evaluated in terms of optimality. The optimality statistic is a measure for the index's sensitivity to fire-induced vegetation depletion. Results show that the GeoCBI--dNBR (differenced NBR) approach yields a moderately high R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.65 whereas the correlation between field data and the differenced NDMI (dNDMI) and the differenced NDVI (dNDVI) was clearly lower (respectively R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.50 and R2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.46). The dNBR also outperformed the dNDMI and dNDVI in terms of optimality. The resulting median dNBR optimality equalled 0.51 whereas the median dNDMI and dNDVI optimality values were respectively 0.50 and 0.40 (differences significant for P o 0.001). However, inaccuracies observed in the spectral indices approach indicate that there is room for improvement. This could imply improved preprocessing, revised index design or alternative methods.},

In particular, hard-seeded species, such as many members of the plant family Fabaceae, may experience differential germination and mortality rates as a result of heterogeneous fire intensities mediated by variable distribution of fine and coarse fuels. Post-fire germination was examined for nine legume species native to longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stands of the southeastern United States in response to fuel variation using a paired laboratory and field study. For both studies, fine fuel loads (longleaf pine needles) and coarse fuels (longleaf pine cones) were manipulated. Germination of seven species was assessed for four months in the field following experimental burns of small plots. Germination and mortality were assessed for six species after exposure to experimental laboratory fires. Burning reduced germination compared to unburned controls in both studies. Furthermore, legumes exposed to burning pine cones experienced greater reductions in germination than when exposed to burning pine needles alone. Manipulation of fine fuel loads did not affect germination in either study. Results suggest that small pieces of coarse woody debris are responsible for differential germination following fire, rather than variation in fine fuels. We present a conceptual model of fine-scale fire effects to explain how long-duration smoldering creates localized mortality events that may drive variation in recruitment from the soil seed bank for longleaf pine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Fire is a natural part of most Australian landscapes and has an important influence on the biological productivity and biotic compositionof many ecosystems. Although fire is commonly used as a management tool, the precise nature of the way it may influence productivity and biotic composition is often poorly understood and, as a consequence, its use is controversial. This paper considers the use of fire for the management of ecosystems. Specifically, the influences of fire on environmental heterogeneity and the effects these have on shaping biological productivity and biotic patterns are discussed. Heterogeneity that affects biotic response includes variation in biophysical attributes of landscapes such as topography, fire regimes and the spatial attributes of fire. Examples are used to address the interplay between fires, environmental heterogeneity and biological pattems: (1) the effects of fires on plant resource availability; (2) crown scorch in eucalypt forests; and (3) the effects of spatial variation (patchiness) within a fire on species composition. Heterogeneity should be considered explicitly in management because prescriptions devised elsewhere may not be able to be imported with confidence to all sites and the responses of the biota to fires may differ from available information. Ecological monitoring and research into the ecological effects of heterogeneity are required to provide a predictive understanding of natural systems and provide information to aid decisions about the use of fire as a management tool.},

The Lodgepole Complex fire burned 109,346~ha in east-central Montana in July 2017, including areas previously burned in 2003 by the Bureau of Land Management for fuels mitigation. We hypothesized that herbaceous productivity and species composition in ponderosa pine woodlands are resistant to moderate grazing and timing of defoliation the first growing season after fire. Eight exclosures (25~{\texttimes}~15~m) were built, 4 on reburned area and 4 on wildfire area. To determine grazing effects, a 15~{\texttimes}~10~m sampling area in each exclosure was paired with a grazed section outside the exclosure. Additionally, four 5x10-m plots were established within each exclosure and were mowed to 10~cm in June, July, August, or not mowed to determine seasonal defoliation effects. Differences between grazed and nongrazed sites in 2019 were limited. There was a trend for less old dead biomass in grazed than nongrazed treatments. Species richness was greater on grazed sites than nongrazed or reburn sites. Native species richness was greater on grazed sites than nongrazed sites and reburn sites had an intermediate level of native species richness. Standing crop was reduced by defoliation, with current year and perennial grass biomass being unaffected. The reduction in standing crop was driven by less old dead biomass on defoliated plots. June defoliation reduced C3 grasses and increased C4 grasses, and June and July defoliation each reduced annual grasses. Simpson's and native Simpson's diversity were greater on defoliated plots. Results indicate ponderosa pine woodland is resilient to moderate post-fire grazing.},

Smith) and needle-and-thread (Stipa comata Trin. and Ruper.) are used as examples. After plants are burned in the field under controlled conditions, ratios are calculated between field-measured durations of temperatures in plants and laboratory-measured thermal death times for plant tissue. If the sum of the ratios for the various temperatures is 1.0 (designated 1 necrotherm) or greater, mortality is attributed to heat; if the sum is less than 1.0, to herbage removal. Further testing of the "predictor" on more species, sites, years, etc., is needed, but the method appears very promising. For the two bunchgrasses tested, heat alone accounted for all mortality by fire, except during July. The time required for a specific temperature to kill plants varied with season. To predict thermal death times for bunchgrasses and thus simplify the laboratory determinations, an empirical equation was developed.},

To use this practice successfully, managers must understand the seasonal windows within which prescribed fire can be applied and how fire behavior could potentially vary among these windows. To characterize prescribed fire windows within the northern Great Plains of North America, we collected data from 20 remote weather stations positioned across North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, USA, from station inception to 2015. We performed an hourly analysis for each station to determine if air temperature (2 to 43 {$^\circ$}C), relative humidity (25 to 80\%), and wind speed (6.44 to 24.12 km h-\,1) conditions were within acceptable ranges for at least six contiguous precipitation-free hours from 0800 to 1800 h. We summarized acceptable conditions over five half-season windows and then used the Rothermel fire spread equation to simulate fire behavior within these half-season windows based on average, minimum, and maximum conditions for seasonally appropriate live herbaceous to fine dead fuel ratios.},
