  abstract = {There is increased interest in the use of summer-season fires to limit woody plant encroachment into grasslands, but effects of these fires on grasses are poorly understood. We quantified effects of repeated winter fires, repeated summer fires, and clipping (to simulate grazing) on aboveground total yield, live yield, and percentage of live tissue of C3 Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha [Trin. \& Rupr.] Pohl.), and C4 buffalograss (Buchlo{\"e} dactyloides [Nutt.] Engelm.) in 2 experiments. Monospecific patches of each species were exposed to 1 of 3 fire treatments (no-fire, 2 winter fires in 3 years, or 2 summer fires in 3 years) and 1 of 2 clip treatments (no clip or clip once each spring). Experiment 1 evaluated effects of fire without grazing or clipping on late-growing season (late-season) yields. Late-season total yield of both species recovered from winter and summer fires within 1 or 2 growing seasons post-fire. By 3 years post-fire, Texas wintergrass late-season total yield was 2 times greater in the summer fire treatment than the winter fire or no-fire treatments, and buffalograss late-season total yield was 3 times greater in summer and winter fire treatments than in the no-fire treatment. Experiment 2 evaluated combined effects of fire and clipping the previous spring on spring-season yields. Clipping alone or with fire (summer or winter) reduced Texas wintergrass yields on more sample dates than occurred with buffalograss. By 3 years post-fire, buffalograss spring total yield was greater in all fire and fire + clip treatments than in the clip only or untreated controls. Results suggest: 1) both species were tolerant of summer fire, 2) fire in either season with or without clipping stimulated buffalograss production, and 3) buffalograss was more tolerant than Texas wintergrass to the combined effects of clipping + fire (either season). Resumen Hay un creciente inter{\'e}s en el uso del fuego en verano para limitar el avance de las plantas le{\~n}osas en los zacatales, pero los efectos de estas quemas en los pastos esta pobremente entendida. En dos experimentos cuantificamos los efectos de quemas repetidas en invierno, quemas repetidas en verano, y corte (simulando el apacentamiento) sobe el rendimiento de biomasa total a{\'e}rea y el rendimiento y porcentaje de tejido vivo del zacate C3 ``Texas wintergrass'' (Nassella leucotricha [Trin. \& Rupr.] Pohl.) y del C4 ``Buffalograss'' (Buchlo{\"e} dactyloides [Nutt.] Engelm.). Parches puros de cada una de estas especies se sometieron a uno de tres tratamientos de fuego (sin fuego, dos fuegos en invierno, o dos fuegos en verano) y a uno de dos tratamientos de corte (sin corte o un corte cada primavera). En el experimento 1 evaluamos los efectos del fuego sin apacentamiento o corte sobre el rendimiento al final de la estaci{\'o}n de crecimiento (rendimiento de final de estaci{\'o}n). El rendimiento total de final de estaci{\'o}n de ambas especies se recuper{\'o} de los fuegos de invierno y verano en una o dos estaciones de crecimiento posteriores a las quemas. Para el tercer a{\~n}o posterior a la quema, el rendimiento total de final de estaci{\'o}n del ``Texas wintergrass'' fue dos veces mayor en el tratamiento de quema en verano que en los tratamientos de quemas en invierno o sin quemas, y el rendimiento del ``Buffalograss'' fue tres veces mayor en los tratamientos de quema en invierno o verano que en el de sin quema. En el experimento 2 evaluamos los efectos combinados del fuego y corte en la primavera previa sobe el rendimiento en primavera. El corte solo o con fuego (en verano o invierno) redujo los rendimientos del ``Texas wintergrass'' en mas fechas de muestreo que en el ``Buffalograss''. Al tercer a{\~n}o posterior al fuego, el rendimiento total de primavera del ``Buffalograss'' fue mayor en todos los tratamientos de fuego y fuego + corte que en el tratamiento de corte solo o en las parcelas control sin tratar. Los resultados sugieren que: 1) ambas especies fueron tolerantes al fuego en verano, 2) el fuego en cualquier estaci{\'o}n, con o sin corte, estimul{\'o} la producci{\'o}n de ``Buffalograss,'' y 3) el ``Buffalograss'' fue m{\'a}s tolerante que el ``Texas wintergrass'' a los efectos combinados de corte + fuego (en cualquier estaci{\'o}n).},

The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates.

Repeated spring burns (dormant season), summer burns, fall burns (dormant season), and unburned treatments were compared over a 3-yr period characterized by wet and dry moisture conditions. Alpha and beta diversity were highest on unburned and summer burn treatments, while landscape mosaic diversity was highest on fall burns. Forb density was highest on fall and spring burn sites. Nine forb species comprised 82\% of total densities and were significantly affected by fire season and year to year variations in moisture. Forb composition for unburned and spring burn treatments was similar, but both treatments were different from the summer burn and fall burn treatments which were similar to each other. Fire alone did not appear to be an intense enough disturbance to initiate drastic changes in the forb component of vegetation patches. Specific fire seasons did appear to either mask or enhance forb structure arising from other disturbance(s). Fire season also affected the scales of forb organization in the landscape. Contrasting spatial characteristics of the forb component of prairie plant communities may provide a diagnostic technique for exposing the interaction of disturbances at different temporal and spatial scales.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTBiomes of the world have long been assumed to be determined by climate. Major disparities, where open low biomass systems occurred in the same climate zone as closed forests have been dismissed as products of deforestation. Many of these open ecosystems of the world, have been shown to be of ancient origins, stable alternatives to forests, and typically maintained by disturbance regimes. Open ecosystems include some of the most biodiverse regions in the world. They are often consumer-controlled by large mammal herbivores or fire. Mosaics of closed forest and open ecosystems have been interpreted as alternative stable states with each state maintained by positive feedbacks to environmental conditions that maintain that state. For example, flammable grasses maintain fires which consume woody plants, while closed forests exclude flammable grasses by shading them out. Understanding open ecosystems may therefore require some radical revision of familiar ecological concepts, starting with the hypothesis that climate largely determines world vegetation patterns. Open ecosystems function differently from forests in an earth system context affecting the hydrological cycle, rates of rock weathering, and presenting a different planetary surface to solar radiation reaching the earth?s land surface. Open ecosystems require explicit attention in conservation policy and management.}

This practice, which is clearly documented in the historic record, may have functioned as a means of making bison--herd movements more predictable and may have enabled higher human carrying capacities in the Plains Woodland period. This hypothesis is meant to stimulate multidisciplinary discussion on a significant, but neglected, topic.},

  abstract = {Recent climatic studies for the dominantly rain-fed agricultural U.S. Corn Belt (CB) suggest an influence of land-use/land-cover (LULC) spatial differences on convective development, set within the larger-scale (synoptic) atmospheric conditions of pressure, winds, and vertical motion. However, the potential role of soil moisture (SM) in the LULC association with atmospheric humidity, horizontal wind, and convective precipitation (CVP) has received more limited attention, mostly as modeling studies or empirical analyses for regions nonanalogous to the CB. Accordingly, we determine the categorical associations between SM and the near-surface atmospheric humidity q, with 850-hPa horizontal wind V 850 at four representative CB locations for the nine warm seasons of 2011--19. Recurring configurations of joint SM--q--V 850 conducive to CVP are then identified and stratified into three phenologically distinct subseasons (early, middle, and late). We show that the stations show some statistical similarity in their SM--CVP relationships. Corn Belt CVP occurs preferentially with high humidity and southerly winds, sometimes composing a low-level jet (LLJ), particularly on early-season days having low SM and late-season days having high SM. Additionally, midseason CVP days having weaker V 850 (i.e., non-LLJ) tend to be associated with medium SM values and high humidity. Conversely, late-season CVP days are frequently characterized by high values of both SM and humidity. These empirical results are likely explained by the inferred sensible and latent heat fluxes varying according to SM content and LULC type. They provide a basis for future mesoscale modeling studies of Corn Belt SM and CVP interactions to test the hypothesized physical processes. Significance Statement The effects of soil moisture on precipitation are not well understood, as previous research has found contrasting results depending on study region and period of focus. We determine these associations for the Corn Belt, a humid lowland region that has received less attention than the drier neighboring Great Plains. Our study finds strong soil moisture--precipitation relationships in the presence of high humidity, which may be explained by mechanisms associated with the subseasonal cycle of vegetation activity. Additionally, our results suggest a generally weaker influence of soil moisture on precipitation for the Corn Belt than for the Great Plains, highlighting the importance of understanding how these relationships vary spatially. Future work should test the inferred surface--atmosphere mechanisms introduced here using mesoscale modeling.},

Wildfires are generally a warm season phenomenon across central and western SD while eastern SD exhibits a spring peak in annual wildfire activity. It is hypothesized that regional climate and land use are the two primary drivers of the spatiotemporal wildfire distribution across the state. To assess the relative impacts of climate to wildfire activity, Spearman\&rsquo;s rank order correlation coefficients were calculated for monthly values of temperature, precipitation, and the Palmer Drought Modified Index (PMDI) as compared to both monthly area burned and numbers of fire starts data for each of the nine climate divisions in South Dakota. Results show statewide variations in significant correlations but positive temperature anomalies, negative precipitation anomalies, and negative values of the PMDI were most frequently associated with months showing substantial area burned and large numbers of wildfire starts. Time-lagged significant correlations were also seen implying month(s)-ahead predictive capabilities. Positive PMDI values were most significantly correlated to warm season wildfire activity suggesting that the influence of drought on wildfires within SD may be limited to the summer months.},

We provide quantitative estimates of potential changes in the number of prescribed burning days in coastal NSW in south-eastern Australia, a fire-prone area dominated by dry sclerophyll forests. Burning days are calculated from an objectively designed regional climate model ensemble using three definitions of suitable weather conditions based on: a literature search (Literature), actual weather observed during recorded prescribed burns (Observed) and operational guidelines (Operational). Contrary to some claims, evidence for a decrease in prescribed burning days under projected future climates is weak. We found a complex pattern of changes, with the potential for substantial and widespread increases in the current burning seasons of autumn (March-May) and spring (AugustOctober). Projected changes were particularly uncertain in northern NSW, spanning substantial increases and decreases during autumn. The magnitude of projected changes in the frequency of burning days was highly sensitive to which definition of suitable weather conditions was used, with a relatively small change for the Operational definition (+0.3 to +1.9 days per year across the study area) and larger ranges for the Observed (+0.2 to +7.9 days) and Literature (+1.7 to +6.2 days) definitions. Interannual variability in the number of burning days is projected to increase slightly under projected climate change. Our study highlights the need for a better understanding of the weather conditions required for safe and effective prescribed burning. Our analysis provides practitioners with quantitative information to assess their exposure to a range of potential changes in the frequency, seasonality and variability of prescribed burning weather conditions.},

In tallgrass prairie systems, prescribed burns are a common method to promote diversity. Managers prefer winter dormant season burns but this timing differs significantly from the historic growing season burns that helped shape this community, and it is largely unexplored whether changing burn season has significant effects on higher trophic levels. Here we investigate how the timing of such burns affects the bee communities and their resources. Depending on life history traits such as above or below ground nesting, timing of fire management can have differential effects on bee diversity. In 2016 and 2017, bees were collected from prairies in south-central Illinois using active netting, pan traps, and vane traps, and measurements of plant species, flower abundance and ground cover were recorded. While both burns showed significant improvement over unburned areas, growing season burns had the greatest total bare ground area and an increase in overall bee abundances. This may suggest long term benefits of growing season burns. The results suggest that growing season burns are beneficial for bees, and the use of either burn season can be utilized for land management.},

Firstly, the displacements of burned and unburned pixels in the pre-/post-fire NIR-MIR and NIR-R bi-spectral spaces were analysed with the aim of establishing which of the two indices was the most sensitive for discriminating severity levels. Then, the capacity of the two indices, both from a uni-temporal (post-fire) and bi-temporal perspective (pre and post-fire), to discriminate three severity levels was studied. Based on the results, it was decided that the most suitable way to assess wildfire severity by index segmentation was to discriminate between unburned and burned pixels according to their NBR pre-/post-fire difference values (dNBR), and, subsequently, to distinguish between pixels with an extreme and moderate severity based on the NBR post-fire values. The thresholds calculated for these indices permitted fire severity mapping with an accuracy of 86.42\% ({\textpm}4.31\%). These thresholds could be extrapolated to other fires with similar characteristics although a calculation of their own specific thresholds could improve the accuracy of the fire severity map obtained.},

VPD is the difference between the water vapor the air can hold at saturation (es) and the actual amount of water vapor (ea). Here we assess changes in VPD, es, and ea in the United States (U.S.) for the recent past (1979--2013) and the future (2065--2099) using gridded, observed climate data and output from general circulation models. Historically, VPD has increased for all seasons, driven by increases in es and declines in ea. The spring, summer, and fall seasons exhibited the largest areal extent of significant increases in VPD, which was largely concentrated in the western and southern portions of the U.S. The changes in VPD stemmed from recent air temperature increases and relative humidity decreases. Projections indicate similar, amplified patterns into the future. For the summer, the general circulation model ensemble median showed a 51\% projected increase (quartile range of 39 and 64\%) in summer VPD for the U.S., reflecting temperature-driven increases in es but decreases or minimal changes in relative humidity that promotes negligible changes in ea. Using a simple model for plant hydraulic functioning, we also show that in the absence of stomatal acclimation, future changes in VPD can reduce stomatal conductance by 9--51\%, which is a magnitude comparable to the expected decline in stomatal conductance from rising CO2.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire is widely accepted as a conservation tool because fire is essential to the maintenance of native biodiversity in many terrestrial communities. Approaches to this land-management technique vary greatly among continents, and sharing knowledge internationally can inform application of prescribed fire worldwide. In North America, decisions about how and when to apply prescribed fire are typically based on the historical-fire-regime concept (HFRC), which holds that replicating the pattern of fires ignited by lightning or preindustrial humans best promotes native species in fire-prone regions. The HFRC rests on 3 assumptions: it is possible to infer historical fire regimes accurately; fire-suppressed communities are ecologically degraded; and reinstating historical fire regimes is the best course of action despite the global shift toward novel abiotic and biotic conditions. We examined the underpinnings of these assumptions by conducting a literature review on the use of historical fire regimes to inform the application of prescribed fire. We found that the practice of inferring historical fire regimes for entire regions or ecosystems often entails substantial uncertainty and can yield equivocal results; ecological outcomes of fire suppression are complex and may not equate to degradation, depending on the ecosystem and context; and habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and other modern factors can interact with fire to produce novel and in some cases negative ecological outcomes. It is therefore unlikely that all 3 assumptions will be fully upheld for any landscape in which prescribed fire is being applied. Although the HFRC is a valuable starting point, it should not be viewed as the sole basis for developing prescribed fire programs. Rather, fire prescriptions should also account for other specific, measurable ecological parameters on a case-by-case basis. To best achieve conservation goals, researchers should seek to understand contemporary fire--biota interactions across trophic levels, functional groups, spatial and temporal scales, and management contexts.},

Where these types exist, recurring changes in foliage alter the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation from the land surface, which can be measured using remote sensors. The timing of these recurring changes in reflectance is called land surface phenology (LSP). During recent decades, a variety of methods have been used to derive LSP metrics from time series of reflectance measurements acquired by satellite-borne sensors. In contrast to conventional phenology observations, LSP metrics represent the timing of reflectance changes that are driven by the aggregate activity of vegetation within the areal unit measured by the satellite sensor and do not directly provide information about the phenology of individual plants, species, or their phenophases. Despite the generalized nature of satellite sensor-derived measurements, they have proven useful for studying changes in LSP associated with various phenomena. This chapter provides a detailed overview of the use of satellite remote sensing to monitor LSP. First, the theoretical basis for the application of satellite remote sensing to the study of vegetation phenology is presented. After establishing a theoretical foundation for LSP, methods of deriving and validating LSP metrics are discussed. This chapter concludes with a discussion of major research findings and current and future research directions.},

These responses are then combined with current literature on bee and plant responses to these methods in tallgrass prairie habitat. While some widely used methods, such as burning, are believed to be fairly benign to bees, there are still many knowledge gaps about how bees may respond to many common practices such as tillage, pesticides, and grazing in tallgrass prairie. Other commonly used methods, such as broadcasting of seeds, are known to significantly affect plant diversity, which could hinder bee conservation efforts. The variability in bee and plant response to commonly used methods highlights why it is necessary to better understand how management methods affect plant and bee communities.},

  abstract = {Localized short-period studies suggest that differences in surface heat fluxes between croplands and remnant forests of the US Corn Belt---the dominant land use-land cover (LULC) types---influence convective cloud formation in the warm season, primarily around crop-forest boundaries. However, an investigation on interannual timescales is needed to help improve understanding of convective climate in relation to LULC. We use spatial cluster analysis to compare convective systems (CS) from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project's Deep Convection Tracking Database to a cropland LULC database for the summer growing seasons (May 1--September 30) of 1999--2007. Spatial--temporal patterns of CS are analyzed with respect to sub-season phenology and LULC type from the National Land Cover Database, and synoptic pressure patterns. The findings indicate two statistically significant clusters of Corn Belt CS; one over the central croplands and the other around crop-forest boundaries in the southeastern area. The clustering of CS, while varying in frequency, remains spatially consistent across sub-seasons and synoptic types. These results suggest a consistent influence of LULC on CS in the Corn Belt that is modulated by synoptic type to either suppress (e.g., via synoptic-scale subsidence) or enhance (via mid-tropospheric upward vertical motion) the frequency of convective clouds and cloud systems. These LULC-related CS clusters are likely the result of non-classical mesoscale circulations originating from spatial contrasts in the surface energy budget and surface roughness between cropland and remnant forests. This study's results will help inform future anticipated modeling projects required to determine these hypothesized LULC-synoptic mechanisms.},

According to a recent study, summers in the Midwest were significantly cooler and wetter due to the dramatic increases in production of corn and soybeans caused by an intensification of agricultural practices (Alter et~al. 2018). In this context, this study examines regional changes manifested in multiple climate variables and directly quantifies the magnitude of potential moisture contributions from Midwest corn and soybean agriculture. Meteorological data were collected for daily minimum, maximum, and dewpoint temperatures over a sixty-one-year study period from fifty-nine National Weather Service first-order stations and cooperative network stations. Regional growing season climatology for two study regions that focused on the rain-fed Midwest Corn Belt and the southern United States extending to the Gulf Coast was analyzed. Further, vapor pressure deficit was calculated to ascertain any regional changes. Field surveys of corn and soybean crop transpiration were used in a multivariate model to estimate lower atmospheric moisture contributions at midday during peak season directly from intensified rain-fed agriculture. Findings indicate an increase in regional dewpoint, associated with elevated nocturnal minimums and suppression of both daily maximum and vapor pressure deficit, concentrated in the Midwest Corn Belt, which was not evident within the South. The estimation results of the atmospheric moisture contributions from the Corn Belt confirm the intensification of Midwestern agriculture as a regional climate modifier.

The strongest statistical response to fire season was higher richness of early-flowering species in replicates burned in July, largely attributable to early-flowering forbs planted in 1986 that persisted better after July burns than in other treatments. Spring fire increased cover of late-flowering C4 grasses. As of 2006, C4 grasses accounted for 76\% cover after May fires, 52\% after July fires, and 39\% in unburned plots. Replicates burned in July held more alien species for the first 12 y, after which alien richness declined and differences among treatments disappeared.

  abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

Historical and prescribed fire regimes for different regions in the continental United States were compared and literature on season of prescribed burning synthesized. In regions and vegetation types where considerable differences in fuel consumption exist among burning seasons, the effects of prescribed fire season appears, for many ecological variables, to be driven more by fire-intensity differences among seasons than by phenology or growth stage of organisms at the time of fire. Where fuel consumption differs little among burning seasons, the effect of phenology or growth stage of organisms is often more apparent, presumably because it is not overwhelmed by fire-intensity differences. Most species in ecosystems that evolved with fire appear to be resilient to one or few out-of-season prescribed burn(s). However, a variable fire regime including prescribed burns at different times of the year may alleviate the potential for undesired changes and maximize biodiversity.},

Moreover, there is a need for effective approaches of providing information about these changes to decision makers, water managers and stakeholders to aid in efficient implementation of the developed strategies. This study involves computation, mapping and analyses of long-term (1968--2013) county-specific trends in annual, growing-season (1st May--30th September) and monthly air temperatures [(maximum (Tmax), minimum (Tmin) and average (Tavg)], daily temperature range (DTR), precipitation, grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and aridity index (AI) over the USA Great Plains region using datasets from over 800 weather station sites. Positive trends in annual Tavg, Tmax and Tmin, DTR, precipitation, ETo and AI were observed in 71\%, 89\%, 85\%, 31\%, 61\%, 38\% and 66\% of the counties in the region, respectively, whereas these proportions were 48\%, 89\%, 62\%, 20\%, 57\%, 28\%, and 63\%, respectively, for the growing-season averages of the same variables.

Differences among species were primarily driven by the dichotomy between cool-season (C3) and warm-season (C4) plants, independent of species native status. Spring burns reduced the cover of cool-season C3 graminoids, but had the opposite effect on C4 graminoids, which likely benefited from increases in resource availability due to the reduction of C3 species. However, summer burns decreased the abundance of C4 graminoids, as summer burns were ignited during the active growing and reproductive period for the C4 species. We found the same patterns for the number of inflorescences of the most abundant C3 and C4 graminoids. Summer burns also increased overall species diversity and the abundance of native C3 graminoids, forbs, and vines, resulting in significant differences in plant community composition between spring- and summer-burned areas. Programs that aim to restore native grassland communities in the short-term using prescribed fire should consider the life history traits of target plants (including invasive species) to determine the best time for prescribed fire implementation.},

  abstract = {Growth of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is limited by drought and heat stress during summer. Understanding the factors associated with performance under drought and heat stress is important for identifying drought and heat stress tolerant germplasm. The objective of this study was to study morphological and physiological responses of five Kentucky bluegrass cultivars subjected to drought and high temperature stress conditions in northwestern arid region of China. Award, Conni, Nuglade, Impact, and Bluechip were grown in three containers (replicates) and exposed to day/night temperatures of 26--37/20--26{$^\circ$}C by withholding irrigation for 21d until complete leaf wilting of most plants. During the stress period, all measurements were made 3d intervals in this experiment. Relative water content (RWC), electrolyte leakage (EL), leaf wilting (LW), turf quality (TQ), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined. Simultaneous drought and heat stresses induced oxidative injury in all cultivars, as demonstrated by the reduction in antioxidant enzymes and increase in lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile it caused turf quality and relative water content to decline, while electrolyte leakage and leaf wilting increased with prolonged stress treatments. All the physiological index under combined drought and heat stress were significantly correlated each other except SOD. This result indicated that when Kentucky bluegrass was stressed by drought and heat, increasing of SOD activity cannot inhibit formation and accumulation of free radicals, and only delay accumulation of free radicals to a certain extent, in order to alleviate active oxygen damage to cells.},

  abstract = {We conducted literature searches of records from Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin to create a source bibliography of wildland fire descriptions occurring between 1673 and 1905. A total of 795 landscape fire records were identified within or near the eastern tallgrass prairie--forest transition region, including 32 attributed to Native Americans, 194 to Europeans from spontaneous records in the nineteenth century, and 569 to Europeans from a systematic dataset collected during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Minnesota. From these historical accounts, we find overwhelming evidence that a two- to three-week period during October and November, known then as ``Indian summer,'' was the primary wildland fire season. Our records indicate that Native Americans used fire primarily for hunting, whereas Euro-American fires were set to reduce fire hazards near their habitations, to eliminate crop residues, and to facilitate plowing, or they were escapes due to mere carelessness. Only five lightning-caused fires were identified. Individual fires frequently burned thousands of hectares, creating dense smoke, damaging trees, personal property, and occasionally burning inhabitants fatally. South and southwest were the most frequent wind directions during wildfires. Drought years, including 1796, 1819, 1856, and 1871, were characterized by extensive fires, which ultimately resulted in legislation to protect property owners and public welfare. Fire events for the study period are certainly underestimated by this dataset because only large, spectacular, threatening fires were recorded, especially during European settlement. In addition, our estimate of Native American fire frequency and prevalence is less than their historical/expected frequency, due to their widespread population collapse and changed hunting methods following contact and dispossession by Europeans.},

  abstract = {This study describes spatial and temporal patterns in fire across the US Western Great Plains over the last 40 years. Although pyrogeographic studies have explored the nexus of fire patterns in relation to the bio-physical environment and socio-ecological trends, most of this research has focused on forested ecosystems and regions long known for conflict between wildfires and human development, especially at the wildland--urban interface. But evidence suggests large wildfire activity is increasing in the US Great Plains, and the Western Great Plains---a Land Resource Region comprised of four ecoregions, Northwestern Plains, High Plains, Nebraska Sandhills, and Southwestern Tablelands---not only contains some of the largest areas of rangeland in the US but also the highest concentration of public land in the Great Plains. As such, the Western Great Plains provides an opportunity to explore fire activity in primarily rural landscapes with a combination of public and private ownership, all dominated by rangeland vegetation. We combined several publicly-available datasets containing fire records between 1992 and 2020 to create two databases, one with georeferenced point data on 60,575 wildfire events in the region, and another with georeferenced perimeter data for 2665 fires. Ignition by humans was the dominant cause of fires. No ecoregion showed a statistically significant trend towards either increasing or decreasing the annual burned area. The Northwestern Plains had the most burned area and the greatest number of incidents---consistently around or above 1000 incidents per year since 1992---with the majority in July. The High Plains showed the greatest increase in annual fire incidence, never reaching more than 200--300 per year 1992--2009, and averaging above 1000 incidents per year since 2010. Few long-term trends in human population, weather, or fuel metrics appear strongly associated with fire patterns in any ecoregion, although the years 2006, 2012, and 2017 stood out for their levels of fire activity, and these years often frequently logged extreme values in wildland fuel metrics. These relationships merit much closer examination in the Western Great Plains, because like other rangeland-dominated landscapes, the fine fuels that comprise these wildland fuelbeds are much more responsive to fine-scale changes in moisture conditions. Rural Western Great Plains landscapes are a mosaic of public and private land ownership, and an increasing impact of wildfires on public grazing lands---which are often situated within other jurisdictions or ownership---will likely have an impact on rural livelihoods.},

  abstract = {In fire-prone ecosystems, plant resilience to recurrent fires depends on certain fire-adaptive traits. However, how key functional and reproductive traits of graminoids respond to varying burning seasons is poorly understood. This meta-analysis, therefore, unpacks global perspectives on how resprouting, growth, reproductive, and productivity traits of graminoids (grasses and sedges) respond to different burning seasons. We recorded 569 observations from 80 experimental studies comparing graminoid plant trait responses in unburned vs. burned treatments over different seasons of burn. Weighted log response ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were analyzed for each plant trait using random effects models and compared across burning seasons. Summer (0.35 (95\%CI = 0.25 to 0.46)) and autumn burns (0.24 (95\%CI = 0.16 to 0.31)) increased above-ground biomass m-2, while biomass plant-1 was increased only by spring burns (0.27 (95\%CI = 0.22 to 0.32)). Bud production plant-1 and tiller-1 were reduced significantly by fire, especially spring, summer, and autumn burns. The shoot height (0.29 (95\%CI = 0.17 to 0.41)), leaf length (0.15 (95\%CI = 0.11 to 0.20)), and specific leaf area (0.08 (95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.09)) increased only under summer burns, while flowering was enhanced by spring (0.19 (95\%CI = 0.00 to 0.38)) and autumn burns [0.34 (95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.66)]. However, seed production m-2 was reduced by spring and summer burns and the opposite was true for seed production plant-1. Overall, herbaceous plant trait responses to fire varied by the season of burn, disagreeing with the general principle that early spring burning is the best practice. We suggest that a decision on the season of burn should be informed by the objective of burning.},

  abstract = {Forests typically have limited high quality nutrition available to meet the seasonal needs of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) during summer. Prescribed fire is used to enhance deer habitat in pyric-disclimax communities but is normally applied during the dormant season. Historically, lightning-ignited fires in pine systems occurred during summer in the southeastern US, but fire ignited by humans occurred at all times of the year and was most common in fall/winter. The different timing of prescribed fire may be important when trying to couple forage resources with nutritionally demanding periods for herbivores. We evaluated fire-timing effects (dormant season, March; growing season, June; and unburned control) on nutrient availability (crude protein, \% phosphorus, and biomass) and nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) for moderate-high use forages of white-tailed deer during summer of 2018 and 2019 in nine mid-rotation loblolly pine stands. Fire increased nutrient content the year of the burn and the increase persisted into the second growing season following growing season fire. Dormant season fire increased protein- and phosphorus- based NCC for two growing seasons but growing season fire reduced biomass during the first year and delayed NCC improvement until the second year. Prescribed fire can be timed to manipulate forage quality, quantity, and improve NCC to recouple forage nutrient supply with herbivore seasonal nutrient demands. We recommend land managers consider diversifying fire timing across the landscape in pyric disclimax systems to support the changing nutrient requirements of large herbivores.},

While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we show that precipitation variability in most climate models increases over a majority of global land area in response to warming (66\% of land has a robust increase in variability of seasonal-mean precipitation). Comparing recent decades to RCP8.5 projections for the end of the 21st century, we find that in the global, multi-model mean, precipitation variability increases 3--4\%\,K-1 globally, 4--5\%\,K-1 over land and 2--4\%\,K-1 over ocean, and is remarkably robust on a range of timescales from daily to decadal. Precipitation variability increases by at least as much as mean precipitation and less than moisture and extreme precipitation for most models, regions, and timescales. We interpret this as being related to an increase in moisture which is partially mitigated by weakening circulation. We show that changes in observed daily variability in station data are consistent with increased variability.},

  abstract = {Vegetation phenology influences many ecosystem and climate processes, such as carbon uptake and energy and water cycles. Thus, understanding drivers of vegetation phenology is crucial for predicting current and future impacts of climate change on ecological systems. Existing models can accurately predict the date of spring green-up in temperate forests but tend to perform poorly in grassland systems. We hypothesize this is because most do not incorporate water availability, a primary limiting factor for grassland plants. In this study, we used long-term datasets of digital imagery from the PhenoCam Network of 43 diverse North American grassland sites (195 site-years) to test existing spring phenology models, as well as develop several new models that incorporate precipitation or soil moisture (53 models). Most of the new models performed substantially better, with the best model requiring sufficient accumulated precipitation followed by warm temperatures to trigger spring onset (root mean square error, RMSE, between predicted and observed dates~=~16.0 days). Importantly, the best model performed well across all grassland types using a single set of parameters, from temperate to arid grasslands. Since plants are adapted to their local climates, model performance was further improved when parameters were independently optimized for four separate climate regions (RMSE~=~10.4 days). Therefore, both sufficient precipitation and temperature are required for grassland green-up, but optimal thresholds vary by region. Running the top model with projected climate data (representative concentration pathway 8.5) suggests that, depending on the climate region, spring onset will occur up to 12 days earlier within 100 years in temperature-limited sites, but the trend is unclear for precipitation-limited sites (3.5 {\textpm} 8.0 days later). This new phenology model improves our ability to understand and predict grassland dynamics, with implications for both current and future ecosystem processes related to carbon and water cycling.},

  abstract = {The northern terrestrial biomes are being remarkably altered by climate change. Higher springtime temperature induces the earlier greening of vegetation, which may further influence ecosystem functions during the subsequent season. However, the response of summer net ecosystem productivity to spring vegetation greenness and phenology changes has not yet been quantified. To understand the impact of such phenological changes on terrestrial carbon sink of the following season, here we integrate remotely-sensed vegetation data and model simulations of carbon flux with an explainable machine learning approach. We find that the lagged effects of widespread earlier spring greening are increasing the summer ecosystem carbon sink across the northern vegetated areas (30{$^\circ$} to 90{$^\circ$}N) from 1982 to 2015. In particular, response disparities exist in non-agricultural biomes, and the vegetation with moderate tree coverage is more sensitive to earlier spring greening. Furthermore, modest tree restoration can strengthen the beneficial effects of earlier spring greening. This study improves our understanding of interseasonal vegetation-climate-carbon coupling that drives the key ecological feedback within climate change projections.},

  abstract = {Fire use has played an important role in human evolution and subsequent dispersals across the globe, yet the relative importance of human activity and climate on fire regimes is controversial. This is particularly true for historical fire regimes of the Americas, where indigenous groups used fire for myriad reasons but paleofire records indicate strong climate--fire relationships. In North American grasslands, decadal-scale wet periods facilitated widespread fire activity because of the abundance of fuel promoted by pluvial episodes. In these settings, human impacts on fire regimes are assumed to be independent of climate, thereby diminishing the strength of climate--fire relationships. We used an offsite geoarchaeological approach to link terrestrial records of prairie fire activity with spatially related archaeological features (driveline complexes) used for intensive, communal bison hunting in north-central Montana. Radiocarbon-dated charcoal layers from alluvial and colluvial deposits associated with driveline complexes indicate that peak fire activity over the past millennium occurred coincident with the use of these features (ca. 1100--1650 CE). However, comparison of dated fire deposits with Palmer Drought Severity Index reconstructions reveal strong climate--fire linkages. More than half of all charcoal layers coincide with modest pluvial episodes, suggesting that fire use by indigenous hunters enhanced the effects of climate variability on prairie fire regimes. These results indicate that relatively small, mobile human populations can impact natural fire regimes, even in pyrogeographic settings in which climate exerts strong, top-down controls on fuels.},

Enhanced flowering, seed production, and germination may be linked to season of fires. We assessed the effect of month of prescribed fire (February, April, May, and July) on percentage of plants with flowering culms (FCs\%), FC/area, FC/plant, seed production, and germination for five warm seasons, fall-flowering grasses. Multivariate analysis indicated the response of flowering and fruiting to burn month varied among the grass species. The dominant species, Sporobolus junceus and Schizachyrium scoparium var. stoloniferum, had greater numbers of most flowering characteristics when burnt during April, May, and July. Aristida purpurascens had increased FC/plant after May and July burns. In contrast, Ar. mohrii had the fewest FC/plant and seeds/FC when burnt in July. Germination was greatest (26--60\%) for Ar. purpurascens. Seeds collected following July burns for Ar. purpurascens and Ar. ternarius and after May burns for S. junceus were within the highest germination values recorded. Germination of Sc. scoparium var. stoloniferum was very low after February and July burns ({$\leq$}5\%). With Ar. mohrii, only seed collected following February (2\%) and April burns (3\%) germinated. April, May, and July fires increased seed production of dominant matrix grasses, thus facilitating the potential for recruitment of these species and facilitating seed collection from potential donor sites for ground-layer restoration projects. Varying prescribed fire burn month captured variation in flowering characteristics among these grasses.},

Late growing-season burns reduced distribution and abundance of panicums (primarily Panicum boscii, P. dichotomum, and P. linearifolium) while late dormant-season burns increased Panicum distribution and abundance. Density of legumes (such as Stylosanthes biflora) increased following frequent or annual dormant-season fires. However, season of fire influenced the distribution and abundance of fewer than 10 \% of the species.

  abstract = {Fire weather indices are commonly used by fire weather forecasters to predict when weather conditions will make a wildland fire difficult to manage. Complex interactions at multiple scales between fire, fuels, topography, and weather make these predictions extremely difficult. We define a new fire weather index called the Hot-Dry-Windy Index (HDW). HDW uses the basic science of how the atmosphere can affect a fire to define the meteorological variables that can be predicted at synoptic-and meso-alpha-scales that govern the potential for the atmosphere to affect a fire. The new index is formulated to account for meteorological conditions both at the Earth's surface and in a 500-m layer just above the surface. HDW is defined and then compared with the Haines Index (HI) for four historical fires. The Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) is used to provide the meteorological data for calculating the indices. Our results indicate that HDW can identify days on which synoptic-and meso-alpha-scale weather processes can contribute to especially dangerous fire behavior. HDW is shown to perform better than the HI for each of the four historical fires. Additionally, since HDW is based on the meteorological variables that govern the potential for the atmosphere to affect a fire, it is possible to speculate on why HDW would be more or less effective based on the conditions that prevail in a given fire case. The HI, in contrast, does not have a physical basis, which makes speculation on why it works or does not work difficult because the mechanisms are not clear.},

Observed increases in wildfire severity and impacts to communities have diverse anthropogenic causes---including the legacy of fire suppression policies, increased development in high-risk zones, and aridification by a warming climate. However, the intentional use of fire as a vegetation management tool, known as ``prescribed fire,'' can reduce the risk of destructive fires and restore ecosystem resilience. Prescribed fire implementation is subject to multiple constraints, including the number of days characterized by weather and vegetation conditions conducive to achieving desired outcomes. Here, we quantify observed and projected trends in the frequency and seasonality of western United States prescribed fire days. We find that while {\textasciitilde}2\,C of global warming by 2060 will reduce such days overall (-17\%), particularly during spring (-25\%) and summer (-31\%), winter (+4\%) may increasingly emerge as a comparatively favorable window for prescribed fire especially in northern states.},

Many plant species from fire-prone ecosystems are adapted to specific fire regimes corresponding to historical conditions and shifts beyond these bounds may have severe impacts on vegetation recovery and long-term species persistence. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of field-based studies across different vegetation types and climate regions to investigate how post-fire plant recruitment, reproduction and survival are affected by fires that occur outside of the historical fire season. We find that fires outside of the historical fire season may lead to decreased post-fire recruitment, particularly in obligate seeding species. Conversely, we find a general increase in post-fire survival in resprouting species.

Despite this, impacts that changes in fire season have on plant populations, or how they interact with other fire regime elements, are still relatively understudied. We asked (a) how does the season of fire affect plant vigor, including vegetative growth and flowering after a fire event, and (b) do different functional resprouting groups respond differently to the effects of season of fire? We sampled a total of 887 plants across 36 sites using a space-for-time design to assess resprouting vigor and reproductive output for five plant species. Sites represented either a spring or autumn burn, aged one to three years old. Season of fire had the clearest impacts on flowering in Lambertia formosa with a 152\% increase in the number of plants flowering and a 45\% increase in number of flowers per plant after autumn compared with spring fires. There were also season {\texttimes} severity interactions for total flowers produced for Leptospermum polygalifolium and L. trinervium with both species producing greater flowering in autumn, but only after lower severity fires. Severity of fire was a more important driver in vegetative growth than fire season. Season of fire impacts have previously been seen as synonymous with the effects of fire severity; however, we found that fire season and severity can have clear and independent, as well as interacting, impacts on post-fire vegetative growth and reproductive response of resprouting species. Overall, we observed that there were positive effects of autumn fires on reproductive traits, while vegetative growth was positively related to fire severity and pre-fire plant size.},

Managers often seek to expand the number of burn days available to accomplish their management objectives, such as hazardous fuel reduction, control of less desired vegetation, and wildlife habitat establishment and maintenance. For this study, we compared prescribed burns conducted in the dormant and early growing seasons in the southern Appalachian Mountains to evaluate how burn outcomes may be affected by environmental factors related to season of burn. The early growing season was defined as the narrow phenological window between bud break and full leaf-out. Proportion of plot area burned, surface fuel consumption, and time-integrated thermocouple heating were quantified and evaluated to determine potential relationships with fuel moisture and topographic and meteorological variables.},

  abstract = {Most wildfires occur during summer in the northern hemisphere, the area burned annually is increasing, and fire effects during this season are least understood. Understanding plant response to grazing following summer fire is required to reduce ecological and financial risks associated with wildfire. Forty 0.75-ha plots were assigned to summer fire then 0, 17, 34 or 50\% biomass removal by grazing the following growing season, or no fire and no grazing. Root, litter, and aboveground biomass were measured before fire, immediately after grazing, and 1 yr after grazing with the experiment repeated during 2 yr to evaluate weather effects. Fire years were followed by the second driest and fifth wettest springs in 70 yr. Biomass was more responsive to weather than fire and grazing, with a 452\% increase from a dry to wet year and 31\% reduction from a wet to average spring. Fire reduced litter 53\% and had no first-year effect on productivity for any biomass component. Grazing after fire reduced postgrazing grass biomass along the prescribed utilization gradient. Fire and grazing had no effect on total aboveground productivity the year after grazing compared to nonburned, nongrazed sites (1 327 vs. 1 249 6 65 kg {\'A} ha{\`A}1). Fire and grazing increased grass productivity 16\%, particularly for Pascopyrum smithii. The combined disturbances reduced forbs (51\%), annual grasses (49\%), and litter (46\%). Results indicate grazing with up to 50\% biomass removal the first growing season after summer fire was not detrimental to productivity of semiarid rangeland plant communities. Livestock exclusion the year after summer fire did not increase productivity or shift species composition compared to grazed sites. Reduction of previous years' standing dead material was the only indication that fire may temporarily reduce forage availability. The consistent responses among dry, wet, and near-average years suggest plant response is species-specific rather than climatically controlled.},

  abstract = {Fire plays a central role in influencing ecosystem patterns and processes. However, documentation of fire seasonality and plant community response is limited in semiarid grasslands. We evaluated aboveground biomass, cover, and frequency response to summer, fall, and spring fires and no fire on silty and clayey sites in semiarid, C3-dominated grassland. The magnitude of change in biomass between years was greater than any differences among fire treatments. Still, differences existed among seasons of fire. Summer fire reduced non-native annual forb frequency (3\% vs. 10\% {\textpm} 2\%) and Hesperostipa comata, reduced native annual forbs the first year, increased Poa secunda and bare ground, and increased Vulpia octoflora the second year. Fall fire increased grass biomass (1224 vs. 1058 {\textpm} 56 kg{$\bullet$}ha-1), but fall fire effects were generally similar to those of summer fire. Spring fire effects tended to be intermediate between no fire and summer and fall fire with the exception that spring fire was most detrimental to H. comata the first growing season and did not increase bare ground. All seasons of fire reduced litter, forb biomass, and frequency of Bromus japonicus and Artemisia spp., and they reduced H. comata, V. octoflora, and native annual forbs the first year, but increased basal cover of C3 perennial grasses (2.2\% vs. 0.6\% {\textpm} 0.4\%). Fire during any season increased dominance of native species compared with no fire (6.6\% vs. 2.0\% {\textpm} 1.0\% basal cover) and maintained productivity. Seasonal timing of fire manipulated species composition, but increased C3 perennial grass cover and native species dominance with fire during any season indicated that using fire was more important than the season in which it occurred. In addition, fire effects on the vegetation components tended to be counter to previously observed effects of grazing, suggesting fire and grazing may be complementary.},

  abstract = {In the US Corn Belt, a recent doubling in commodity prices has created incentives for landowners to convert grassland to corn and soybean cropping. Here, we use land cover data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer to assess grassland conversion from 2006 to 2011 in the Western Corn Belt (WCB): five states including North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa. Our analysis identifies areas with elevated rates of grass-to-corn/soy conversion (1.0--5.4\% annually). Across the WCB, we found a net decline in grass-dominated land cover totaling nearly 530,000 ha. With respect to agronomic attributes of lands undergoing grassland conversion, corn/soy production is expanding onto marginal lands characterized by high erosion risk and vulnerability to drought. Grassland conversion is also concentrated in close proximity to wetlands, posing a threat to waterfowl breeding in the Prairie Pothole Region. Longer-term land cover trends from North Dakota and Iowa indicate that recent grassland conversion represents a persistent shift in land use rather than short-term variability in crop rotation patterns. Our results show that the WCB is rapidly moving down a pathway of increased corn and soybean cultivation. As a result, the window of opportunity for realizing the benefits of a biofuel industry based on perennial bioenergy crops, rather than corn ethanol and soy biodiesel, may be closing in the WCB.},

  abstract = {Vegetation phenology plays an important role in regulating land-atmosphere energy, water, and trace-gas exchanges. Changes in spring greenup (SG) have been documented in the past half-century in response to ongoing climate change. We use normalized difference vegetation index generated from NOAA's advanced very high resolution radiometer data in the Global Inventory Modeling and Monitoring Study project over the 1982--2005 period, coupled with climate reanalysis (Climate Research Unit-National Centers for Environmental Prediction) to investigate the SG responses to preseason climate change in northern temperate and boreal regions. We compared these observed responses to the simulated SG responses to preseason climate inferred from the Earth system models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) over 1982--2005. The observationally inferred SG suggests that there has been an advance of about 1 days per decade between 1982 and 2005 in the northern midlatitude to high latitude, with significant spatial heterogeneity. The spatial heterogeneity of the SG advance results from heterogeneity in the change of the preseason climate as well as varied vegetation responses to the preseason climate across biomes. The SG to preseason temperature sensitivity is highest in forests other than deciduous needleleaf forests, followed by temperate grasslands and woody savannas. The SG in deciduous needleleaf forests, open shrublands, and tundra is relatively insensitive to preseason temperature. Although the extent of regions where the SG is sensitive to preseason precipitation is smaller than the extent of regions where the SG is sensitive to preseason temperature, the biomes that are more sensitive to temperature are also more sensitive to precipitation, suggesting the interactive control of temperature and precipitation. In the mean, the CMIP5 ESMs reproduced the dominant latitudinal preseason climate trends and SG advances. However, large biases in individual ESMs for the preseason period, climate, and SG sensitivity imply needed model improvements to climate prediction and phenological process parameterizations.},

  abstract = {Prescribed fire is an important management practice used to control woody encroachment and invasive species in grasslands. To use this practice successfully, managers must understand the seasonal windows within which prescribed fire can be applied and how fire behavior could potentially vary among these windows. To characterize prescribed fire windows within the northern Great Plains of North America, we collected data from 20 remote weather stations positioned across North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, USA, from station inception to 2015. We performed an hourly analysis for each station to determine if air temperature (2 to 43 {$^\circ$}C), relative humidity (25 to 80\%), and wind speed (6.44 to 24.12 km h-\,1) conditions were within acceptable ranges for at least six contiguous precipitation-free hours from 0800 to 1800 h. We summarized acceptable conditions over five half-season windows and then used the Rothermel fire spread equation to simulate fire behavior within these half-season windows based on average, minimum, and maximum conditions for seasonally appropriate live herbaceous to fine dead fuel ratios.},

  abstract = {Climate and vegetation phenology are closely linked, and climate change is already impacting phenology in many systems. These impacts are expected to progress in the future. We sought to forecast future shifts in rangeland growing season timing due to climate change, and interpret their importance for land management and ecosystem function. We trained a model on remotely sensed land surface phenology and climate data collected from 2001 to 2014 in temperate United States rangelands. We used this model to forecast annual growing season start dates, end dates, and season length through 2099 among six general circulation models and under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Growing season start was projected to shift earlier throughout our study area. In 2090--2099, start of season advanced by an average of 10 (RCP 4.5) to 17 (RCP 8.5) days. End of season also advanced by 12 (RCP 4.5) to 24 (RCP 8.5) days, but with greater heterogeneity. Start and end of season change mainly offset one another, so growing season length changes were lesser (2~days in RCP 4.5, and 7 in RCP 8.5). Some mountainous areas experienced both earlier start of season and later end of season, lengthening their growing season. Earlier phenology in rangelands would force adaptation in grazing and impact ecosystem function. Mountainous areas with earlier start and later end of season may become more viable for grazing, but most areas may experience slightly shortened growing seasons. Autumn phenology warrants greater research, and our finding of earlier autumn senescence contradicts some prior research.},
